<h2 class="chap1">CHAPTER I<br />
WHEN SLOW-COACH GOT HIS FIGHTING
CHANCE</h2>

<p>"Rod!"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Rod, what did that messenger boy bring? A
special-delivery letter? Is it anything interesting?"
Marian Hallowell pushed Empress from
her knee and turned on her pillows to look at
Roderick, her brother, who sat absorbed and silent
at his desk.</p>

<p>Roderick did not move. Only Empress cocked
a topaz eye, and rubbed her orange-tawny head
against Marian's chair.</p>

<p>"Rod, why don't you answer me?" Marian's
thin hands twitched. A sharp, fretted line deepened
across her pretty, girlish forehead. It was
not a pleasant line to see. And through her long,
slow convalescence it had grown deeper every day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Roderick Hallowell!</i>"</p>

<p>Roderick jumped. He turned his sober, kind
face to her, then bent eagerly to the closely written
letter in his hand.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Sis."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, Slow-Coach!" Marian lay back,
with a resigned sniff. She pulled Empress up by
her silver collar, and lay petting the big, satiny
Persian, who purred like a happy windmill against
her cheek. Her tired eyes wandered restlessly
about the dim, high-ceiled old room. Of all the
dreary lodgings on Beacon Hill, surely Roderick
had picked out the most forlorn! Still, the old
place was quiet and comfortable. And, as Roderick
had remarked, his rooms were amazingly inexpensive.
That had been an important point;
especially since Marian's long, costly illness at
college. That siege had been hard on Rod in many
ways, she thought, with a mild twinge of self-reproach.
In a way, those long weeks of suffering
had come through her own fault. The college
physician had warned her more than once that
she was working and playing beyond her strength.
Yet she felt extremely ill-used.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>"It wasn't nearly so bad, while I stayed in the
infirmary at college." She sighed as she thought
of her bright, airy room, the coming and going of
the girls with their gay petting and sympathy,
the roses and magazines and dainties. "But here,
in this tiresome, lonely place! How can I expect
to get well!"</p>

<p>Here she lay, shut up in Rod's rooms, alone day
after day, save for the vague, pottering kindnesses
of Rod's vague old landlady. At night her
brother would come home from his long day's
work as cub draughtsman in the city engineer's
office, too tired to talk. And Marian, forbidden by
overstrained eyes to read, could only lie by the
fire, and tease Empress, and fret the endless hours
away.</p>

<p>At last, with a deep breath, Rod laid down the
letter. He pulled his chair beside her lounge.</p>

<p>"Tired, Sis?"</p>

<p>"Not very. What was your letter, Rod?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you pretty soon. Anything doing
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Isabel and Dorothy came in from Wellesley
this morning, and brought me those lovely violets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
and told me all about the Barn Swallows' masque
dance last night. And the doctor came this afternoon."</p>

<p>"H'm. What did he say?"</p>

<p>Marian gloomed.</p>

<p>"Just what he always says. 'No more study
this year. Out-door life. Bread and milk and
sleep.' Tiresome!"</p>

<p>Roderick nodded.</p>

<p>"Hard lines, Sister. And yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>He dropped his sentence, and sat staring at the
fire.</p>

<p>"Rod! Are you never going to tell me what is
in that letter?"</p>

<p>"That letter? Oh, yes. Sure it won't tire you
to talk business?"</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;I have an offer of a new position.
A splendid big one at that."</p>

<p>"A new position? Truly?" Marian sat up,
with brightening eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes. But I'm not sure I can swing it." Rod's
face clouded. "It demands a mighty competent
engineer."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>"Well! Aren't you a competent engineer?"
Marian gave his ear a mild tweak. "You're always
underrating yourself, you old goose. Tell
me about this. Quick."</p>

<p>Rod's thoughtful face grew grave.</p>

<p>"It's such a gorgeous chance that I can't half
believe in it," he said, at length. "Through Professor
Young, I'm offered an engineer's billet with
the Breckenridge Engineering and Construction
Company. The Breckenridge Company is the
largest and the best-known firm of engineers in the
United States. Breckenridge himself is a wonder.
I'd rather work under him than under any man I
ever heard of. The work is a huge drainage contract
in western Illinois. One hundred dollars
a month and all my expenses. It's a two-year
job."</p>

<p>"A two-year position, out West!" Marian's
eyes shone. "The out-West part is dreadful, of
course. But think of a hundred-dollar salary,
after the sixty dollars that you have been drudging
to earn ever since you left Tech! Read Professor
Young's letter aloud; do."</p>

<p>Roderick squirmed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you don't want to hear it. It's nothing
much."</p>

<p>"Yes I do, too. Read it, I say. Or&mdash;give it to
me. There!"</p>

<p>There was a short, lively scuffle. However,
Marian had captured the letter with the first deft
snatch; and Roderick could hardly take it from
her shaky, triumphant hands by main force. He
gave way, grumbling.</p>

<p>"Professor Young always says a lot of things
he doesn't mean. He does it to brace a fellow up,
that's all."</p>

<p>"Very likely." Marian's eyes skimmed down
the first page.</p>

<p>"'&mdash;And as the company has asked me to recommend
an engineer of whose work I can speak from
first-hand knowledge, I have taken pleasure in referring
them to you. To be sure, you have had no
experience in drainage work. But from what I
recall of your record at Tech, your fundamental
training leaves nothing to be desired. When it
comes to handling the mass of rough-and-ready
labor that the contract employs, I am confident
that your father's son will show the needed judgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
and authority. It is a splendid undertaking,
this reclamation of waste land. It is heavy,
responsible work, but it is a man's work, straight
through; and there is enough of chance in it to
make it a man's game, as well. If you can make
good at this difficult opportunity, you will prove
that you can make good at any piece of drainage
engineering that comes your way. This is your
fighting chance at success. And I expect to see
you equal to its heaviest demands. Good luck
to you!'</p>

<p>"That sounds just like Professor Young. And
he means it. Every word." Marian folded the
letter carefully and gave it back to her brother.
"Honestly, Rod, it does sound too good to be true.
And think, what a frabjous time you can have
during your vacations! You can run over to the
Ozarks for your week-ends, and visit the Moores
on their big fruit ranch, and go mountain-climbing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roderick chortled.</p>

<p>"The Ozarks would be a trifling week-end jaunt
of three hundred miles, old lady. Didn't they
teach you geography at Wellesley? As to mountains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
that country is mostly pee-rary and swamp.
That's why this contract will be a two-year job,
and a stiff job at that."</p>

<p>"What does district drainage work mean, anyway?"</p>

<p>"In district drainage, a lot of farmers and
land-owners unite to form what is called, in law,
a drainage district. A sort of mutual benefit
association, you might call it. Then they tax
themselves, and hire engineers and contractors to
dig a huge system of ditches, and to build levees
and dikes, to guard their fields against high
water. You see, an Illinois farmer may own a
thousand acres of the richest alluvial land. But
if half that land is swamp, and the other half lies
so low that the creeks near by may overflow and
ruin his crops any day, then his thousand mellow
acres aren't much more use than ten acres of hard-scrabble
here in New England. To be sure, he can
cut his own ditches, and build his own levee, without
consulting his neighbors. But the best way is
for the whole country-side to unite and do the
work on a royal scale."</p>

<p>"How do they go about digging those ditches?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Where can they find laboring men to do the work,
away out in the country?"</p>

<p>"Why, you can't dig a forty-foot district canal
by hand, Sis! That would be a thousand-year
job. First, the district calls in an experienced
engineer to look over the ground and make plans
and estimates. Next, it employs a drainage contractor;
say, the Breckenridge firm. This firm
puts in three or four huge steam dredge-boats, a
squad of dump-carts and scrapers, an army of laborers,
and a staff of engineers&mdash;including your
eminent C. E. brother&mdash;to oversee the work. The
dredges begin by digging a series of canals; one
enormous one, called the main ditch, which runs
the length of the district and empties into some
large body of water; in this case, the Illinois
River. Radiating from this big ditch, they cut
a whole family of little ditches, called laterals.
The main ditch is to carry off the bulk of water in
case of freshets; while the laterals drain the individual
farms."</p>

<p>"It sounds like slow, costly work."</p>

<p>"It is. And you've heard only half of it, so far.
Then, following the dredges, come the laborers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
with their teams and shovels and dump-carts.
Along the banks of the ditch they build low
brush-and-stone-work walls and fill them in with
earth. These walls make a levee. So, even if the
floods come, and your ditch runs bank-full, the
levee will hold back the water and save the crops
from ruin. Do you see?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es. But it sounds rather tangled, Rod."</p>

<p>"It isn't tangled at all. Look." Rod's pencil
raced across the envelope. "Here's a rough outline
of this very contract. This squirmy line is Willow
Creek. It is a broad, deep stream, and it runs for
thirty crooked miles through the district, with
swampy shores all the way. A dozen smaller
creeks feed into it. They're swampy, too. So
you can see how much good rich farm-land is being
kept idle.</p>

<p>"This straight line is the main ditch, as planned.
It will cut straight through the creek course, as the
crow flies. Do you see, that means we'll make a
new channel for the whole stream? A straight,
deep channel, too, not more than ten miles long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
instead of the thirty twisted, wasteful miles of the
old channel. The short lines at right angles to the
main ditch represent the little ditches, or laterals.
They'll carry off surplus water from the farm-lands:
even from those that lie back from the
creek, well out of harm's way."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="400" height="41" alt="Sketch of Ditch" />
</div>

<p>"What will your work be, Rod?"</p>

<p>"I'll probably be given a night shift to boss.
That is&mdash;if I take the job at all. The laborers are
divided into two shifts, eleven hours each. The
dredges have big search-lights, and puff along by
night, regardless."</p>

<p>"How will you live?"</p>

<p>"We engineers will be allotted a house-boat to
ourselves, and we'll mess together. The laborers
live on a big boat called the quarter-boat. The
firm furnishes food and bunks, tools, stationery,
everything, even to overalls and quinine."</p>

<p>"Quinine?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Those Illinois swamps are chock-full
of chills and fever."</p>

<p>"Cheerful prospect! What if you get sick,
Rod?"</p>

<p>"Pooh. I never had a sick day in all my life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
However, the farm-houses, up on higher ground,
are out of the malaria belt. If I get so Miss
Nancy-fied that I can't stay in the swamp, I can
sleep at a farm-house. They say there are lots
of pleasant people living down through that section.
It is a beautiful country, too. I&mdash;I'd like
it immensely, I imagine."</p>

<p>"Of course you will. But what makes you
speak so queerly, Rod? You're certainly going to
accept this splendid chance!"</p>

<p>Rod's dark, sober face settled into unflinching
lines.</p>

<p>"We'll settle that later. What about you,
Sis? If I go West, where will you go? How will
you manage without me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll go up to Ipswich for the summer. Just
as I always do."</p>

<p>Rod considered.</p>

<p>"That won't answer, Marian. Now that the
Comstocks have moved away, there is nobody
there to look after you. And you'd be lonely,
too."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I can go to Dublin. Cousin
Evelyn will give me a corner in her cottage."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>"But Cousin Evelyn sails for Norway in June."</p>

<p>"Dear me, I forgot! Then I'll visit some of the
girls. Isabel was teasing me this morning to come
to their place at Beverly Farms for August.
Though&mdash;I don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rod's serious young eyes met hers. A slow red
mounted to his thatched black hair.</p>

<p>"I don't believe that would work, Sis. I hate
to spoil your fun. But&mdash;we can't afford that sort
of thing, dear."</p>

<p>"I suppose not. To spend a month with Isabel
and her mother, in that Tudor palace of theirs, full
of man-servants, and maid-servants, and regiments
of guests, and flocks and herds of automobiles,
would cost me more, in new clothes alone, than
the whole summer at Ipswich. But, Rod, where
can I stay? I'd go cheerfully and camp on my
relatives, only we haven't a relative in the world,
except Cousin Evelyn. Besides, I&mdash;I don't see
how I can ever stand it, anyway!" Her fretted
voice broke, quivering. Mindful of Rod's boyish
hatred of sentiment, she gulped back the sob in
her throat; but her weak hand clutched his sleeve.
"There are only the two of us, Rod, and we've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
never been separated in all our lives. Not even
for a single week. I&mdash;I can't let you go away out
there and leave me behind."</p>

<p>Now, on nine occasions out of ten, Slow-Coach
was Rod's fitting title. This was the tenth time.
He stooped over Marian, his black eyes flashing.
His big hand caught her trembling fingers tight.</p>

<p>"That will just do, Sis. Stop your forebodings,
you precious old 'fraid-cat. I'm going to pack you
up and take you right straight along."</p>

<p>"Why, Roderick Thayer Hallowell!"</p>

<p>Marian gasped. She stared up at her brother,
wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Why, I couldn't possibly go with you. It's
absurd. I daren't even think of it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's such a queer, wild place. And it is
so horribly far away. And I'm not strong enough
for roughing it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Illinois isn't a frontier. It's only
two days' travel from Boston. As for roughing
it, think of the Vermont farm-houses where we've
stayed on fishing trips. Remember the smothery
feather-beds, and the ice-cold pickled beets and pie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
for breakfast? Darkest Illinois can't be worse
than that."</p>

<p>"N-no, I should hope not. But it will be so
tedious and dull!"</p>

<p>"Didn't the doctor order you to spend a dull
summer? Didn't he prescribe bread and milk
and sleep?"</p>

<p>"Rod, I won't go. I can't. I'd be perfectly
miserable. There, now!"</p>

<p>Roderick gave her a long, grave look.</p>

<p>"Then I may as well write and decline the
Breckenridge offer, Sis. For I'll take you with
me, or else stay here with you. That's all."</p>

<p>"Rod, you're so contrary!" Marian's lips
quivered. "You must go West. I won't have
you stay here and drudge forever at office work.
You must not throw away this splendid chance.
It isn't possible!"</p>

<p>"It isn't possible for me to do anything else,
Sis." Roderick's stolid face settled into granite
lines. Marian started at the new ring of authority
in his voice. "Haven't you just said that you
couldn't stand it to be left behind? Well, I&mdash;I'm
in the same boat. I can't go off and leave you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Sis. I won't run the chances of your being sick,
or lonely, while I'm a thousand miles away. So
you'll have to decide for us both. Either you go
with me, or else I stay here and drudge forever,
as you call it. For I'd rather drudge forever than
face that separation. That's all. Run along to
bed now, that's a good girl. You'll need plenty
of sleep if you are to start for Illinois with me next
week. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Well, but Rod&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Run along, I say. Take Empress with you.
I want to answer this letter, and she keeps purring
like a buzz-saw, and sharpening her claws on
my shoes, till I can't think straight."</p>

<p>"But, Rod, you don't understand!" Marian
caught his arm. Her eyes brimmed with angry
tears. "I don't <i>want</i> to go West. I'll hate it.
I know I shall. I want to stay here, where I can
be with my friends, where I can have a little fun.
It's not fair to make me go with you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand, all right." Roderick's eyes
darkened. "You will not like the West. You'll
not be contented. I know that. But, remember,
I'm taking this job for both of us, Sis. We're
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
partners, you know. I wish you could realize
that." His voice grew a little wistful. "If you'd
be willing to play up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll play up, of course." Marian put her
hands on his shoulders and gave him a pettish
kiss. "And I'll go West with you. Though I'd
rather go to Moscow or the Sahara. Come, Empress!
Good-night, Rod."</p>

<p>The door closed behind her quick, impatient
step. Roderick sat down at his desk and opened
his portfolio. He did not begin to write at once.
Instead, he sat staring at the letter in his hand.
He was a slow, plodding boy; he was not given
to dreaming; but to-night, as he sat there, his
sober young face lighted with eager fire. Certain
phrases of that magical letter seemed to float and
gleam before his eyes.</p>

<p>&mdash;"'A splendid undertaking ... heavy, responsible
work, but a man's work, and a man's game....
This is your fighting chance. If you can
make good.... And I expect to see you equal to
its heaviest demands.'"</p>

<p>Rod's deep eyes kindled slowly.</p>

<p>"I'll make good, all right," he muttered. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
strong hand clinched on the folded sheet. "It's
my fighting chance. And if I can't win out, with
such an opportunity as this one&mdash;then I'll take my
name off the <i>Engineering Record</i> roster and buy me
a pick and a shovel!"
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
TRAVELLERS THREE</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"Ready, Marian? The Limited starts in thirty
minutes. We haven't a minute to spare."</p>

<p>"Y-yes." Marian caught up her handbag and
hurried into the cab. "Only my trunk keys&mdash;I'm
not sure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your trunk keys! You haven't lost them, of
all things!"</p>

<p>"No. Here they are, safe in my bag. But
Empress has been so frenzied I haven't known
which way to turn."</p>

<p>Poor insulted Empress, squirming madly in a
wicker basket, glared at Rod, and lifted a wild,
despairing yowl.</p>

<p>"You don't propose to leave Mount Vernon
Street for the wilds of Illinois without a struggle,
do you, Empress?" chuckled Rod. "Never you
mind. You'll forget your blue silk cushion and
your minced steak and cream, and you'll be chasing
plebeian chipmunks in a week. Look at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
river, Marian. You won't see it again in a long
while."</p>

<p>Marian followed his glance. It was a silver hoar-frost
morning. The sky shone a cloudless blue,
the cold, delicious air sparkled, diamond-clear.
Straight down Mount Vernon Street the exquisite
little panel of the frozen Charles gleamed like a
vista of fairyland. Marian stared at it a little
wistfully.</p>

<p>"It will all be very different out West, I suppose.
I wonder if any Western river can be half
as lovely," she pondered.</p>

<p>Roderick did not answer. A sudden worried
question stirred in his thought. Yes, the West
would be "different." Very different.</p>

<p>"Maybe I've done the worst possible thing in
dragging Marian along," he thought. "But it's
too late to turn back now. I can only hope that
she can stand the change, and that she'll try to be
patient and contented."</p>

<p>Marian, on her part, was in high spirits. She
had been shut up for so long that to find herself
free, and starting on this trip to a new country, delighted
her beyond bounds. At South Station, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
crowd of her Wellesley chums stormed down upon
her, in what Rod described later as a mass-play,
laden with roses and chocolates and gay, loving
farewells. Marian tore herself from their hands,
half-laughing, half-crying with happy excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rod, I know we're going to have the
grandest trip, and the most beautiful good fortunes
that ever were!" she cried, as he put her
carefully aboard the train. "But you aren't one
bit enthusiastic. You stodgy tortoise, why can't
you be pleased, too?"</p>

<p>"I'm only too glad if you like the prospect,
Sis," he answered soberly.</p>

<p>Marian's spirits soared even higher as the hours
passed. Roderick grew as rapt as she when the
train whirled through the winter glory of the
Berkshires. Every slope rose folded in dazzling
snow. Every tree, through mile on mile of forest,
blazed in rainbow coats of icy mail. The wide
rolling New York country was scarcely less beautiful.</p>

<p>At Buffalo, the next morning, a special pleasure
awaited them. A party of friends met them with
a huge touring car, and carried them on a flying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
trip to the ice-bridge at Niagara Falls. To
Marian, every minute spelled enchantment. She
forgot her dizzy head and her aching bones, and
fairly exulted in the wild splendor of the blue ice-walled
cataract. Roderick, on his part, was so
absorbed by the marvellous engineering system
of the great power-plant that for once he had no
eyes nor thought for his sister, nor for any other
matter.</p>

<p>Their wonderful day closed with an elaborate
dinner-party, given in their honor. Neither
Marian nor Rod had ever been guests at so grand
an affair. As they dashed to their train in their
host's beautiful limousine, Marian looked up from
her bouquet of violets and orchids with laughing
eyes.</p>

<p>"If this is the West, Rod, I really think it will
suit me very well!"</p>

<p>Rod's mouth twisted into a rueful grin.</p>

<p>"Glad you enjoy it, Sis. Gloat over your luxury
while you may. You'll find yourself swept
out of the limousine zone all too soon. By this
time next week you'll be thankful for a spring
wagon."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>By the next morning, Marian's spirits began to
flag. All day they travelled in fog and rain, down
through a flat, dun country. Not a gleam of snow
lightened those desolate, muddy plains. There
seemed no end to that sodden prairie, that gray
mist-blotted sky. Marian grew more lonely and
unhappy with every hour. She struggled to be
good-humored for Roderick's sake. But she grew
terribly tired; and it was a very white-faced
girl who clung to Roderick's arm as their train
rolled into the great, clanging terminal at Saint
Louis.</p>

<p>Roderick hurried her to a hotel. It seemed to
her that she had scarcely dropped asleep before
Rod's voice sounded at the door.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Sis, but we'll have to start right away.
It's nearly eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"Oh, Rod, I'm so tired! Please let's take a
later train."</p>

<p>"There isn't any later train, dear. There isn't
any train at all. We're going up-river on a little
steamer that is towing a barge-load of coal to our
camp. That's the only way to reach the place.
There is no railroad anywhere near. There won't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
be another steamer going up for days. It's a
shame to haul you out, but it can't be helped."</p>

<p>An hour later, they picked their way down the
wet, slippery stones of the levee to where the
<i>Lucy Lee</i>, a tiny flat-bottomed "stern-wheeler,"
puffed and snorted, awaiting them. As they
crossed the gang-plank, the pilot rang the big
warning bell. Immediately their little craft nosed
its way shivering along the ranks of moored
packets, and rocked out into mid-channel.</p>

<p>Marian peered back, but she could see nothing
of the city. A thick icy fog hung everywhere,
shrouding even the tall warehouses at the river's
edge, and drifting in great, gray clouds over the
bridges.</p>

<p>"The river is still thick with floating ice," said
the captain, at her elbow. "The <i>Lucy</i> is the first
steam-boat to dare her luck, trying to go up-stream,
since the up-river ice gorge let go. But we'll
make it all right. It's a pretty chancy trip, yet
it's not as dangerous as you'd think."</p>

<p>Marian twinkled. "It looks chancy enough to
me," she confessed. She looked out at the broad,
turbid stream. Here and there a black patch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
marked a drifting ice cake, covered with brush,
swept down from some flooded woodland. Through
the mist she caught glimpses of high, muddy banks,
a group of sooty factories, a gray, murky sky.</p>

<p>"I don't see much charm to the Mississippi,
Rod. Is this all there is to it? Just yellow, tumbling
water, and mud, and fog?"</p>

<p>"It isn't a beautiful stream, that's a fact,"
admitted Rod. Yet his eyes sparkled. He was
growing more flushed and alert with every turn of
the wheels that brought him nearer to his coveted
work, his man's game. "This is too raw and cold
for you, Marian. Come into the cabin, and I'll
fix you all snug by the fire."</p>

<p>"The cabin is so stuffy and horrid," fretted
Marian. Yet she added, "But it's the cunningest
place I ever dreamed of. It's like a miniature
museum."</p>

<p>"A museum? A junk-shop, I'd call it," Rod
chuckled, as he settled her into the big red-cushioned
rocker, before the roaring cannon stove.</p>

<p>The tight little room was crowded with solemn
black-walnut cabinets, full of shells and arrowheads,
and hung thick with quaint, high-colored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
old pictures. Languishing ladies in chignons and
crinoline gazed upon lordly gentlemen in tall
stocks and gorgeous waistcoats; "Summer Prospects,"
in vivid chromos fronted "Snow Scenes,"
made realistic with much powdered isinglass.
Crowning all, rose a tall, cupid-wreathed gilt mirror,
surmounted by a stern stuffed eagle, who
glared down fiercely from two yellow glass eyes.
His mighty wings spread above the mirror, a bit
moth-eaten, but still terrifying.</p>

<p>"Look, Empress. Don't you want to catch
that nice birdie?"</p>

<p>Poor bewildered Empress glared at the big bird,
and sidled, back erect, wrathfully sissing, under a
chair. Travel had no charms for Empress.</p>

<p>"Will you look at that old yellowed pilot's
map and certificate in the acorn frame? '1857!'"
chuckled Rod. "And the red-and-blue worsted
motto hung above it: 'Home, Sweet Home!'
I'll wager Grandma Noah did that worsted-work."</p>

<p>"Not Grandma Noah, but Grandma McCloskey,"
laughed the captain. "She was the nicest
old lady you ever laid eyes on. She used to live
on the boat and cook for us, till the rheumatism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
forced her to live ashore. Her husband is old
Commodore McCloskey; so everybody calls him.
He has been a pilot on the Mississippi ever since
the day he got that certificate, yonder. He's a
character, mind that. He shot that eagle in '58,
and he has carried it around with him ever since,
to every steamer that he has piloted. You must
go up to the pilot-house after a bit and make him
a visit. He's worth knowing."</p>

<p>"I think I'd like to go up to the pilot-house
right away, Rod. It is so close and hot down
here."</p>

<p>Obediently Rod gathered up her rugs and cushions.
Carefully he and the captain helped her up
the swaying corkscrew stairs, across the dizzy,
rain-swept hurricane deck, then up the still narrower,
more twisty flight that ended at the door of
the high glass-walled box, perched like a bird-cage,
away forward.</p>

<p>Inside that box stood a large wooden wheel, and
a small, twinkling, white-bearded old gentleman,
who looked for all the world like a Santa Claus
masquerading in yellow oilskins.</p>

<p>"Ask him real pretty," cautioned the captain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
"He thinks he runs this boat, and everybody
aboard her. He does, too, for a fact."</p>

<p>With much ceremony Roderick rapped at the
glass door, and asked permission for his sister to
enter. With grand aplomb the little old gentleman
rose from his wheel and ushered her up the
steps.</p>

<p>"'Tis for fifty-four years that I and me pilot-house
have been honored by the ladies' visits,"
quoth he, with a stately bow. "Ye'll sit here,
behind the wheel, and watch me swing herself up
the river? Sure, 'tis a ticklish voyage, wid the
river so full of floatin' ice. I shall be glad of yer
gracious presence, ma'am. It will bring me good
luck in me steerin'."</p>

<p>Marian's eyes danced. She fitted herself neatly
into the cushioned bench against the wall. The
pilot-house was a bird-cage, indeed, hardly eight
feet square. The great wheel, swinging in its
high frame, took up a third of the space; a huge
cast-iron stove filled one corner. For the rest,
Marian felt as if she had stepped inside one of the
curio-cabinets in the cabin below; for every
inch of wall space in the bird-cage was festooned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
with mementoes of every sort. A string of
beautiful wampum, all polished elks' teeth and uncut
green turquoise; shell baskets, and strings of
buckeyes; a four-foot diamond-back rattlesnake's
skin, beautiful and uncanny, the bunch of five
rattles tied to the tail. Close beside the glittering
skin hung even an odder treasure-trove: a
small white kid glove, quaintly embroidered in
faded pink-and-blue forget-me-nots.</p>

<p>"Great-Aunt Emily had some embroidered
gloves like that in her trousseau," thought Marian.
"I do wonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye're lookin' at me keepsakes?" The pilot
sighted up-stream, then turned, beaming. "Maybe
it will pass the time like for me to tell ye of
them. There is not one but stands for an adventure.
That wampum was given to me by Chief
Ogalalla; a famous Sioux warrior, he was. 'Twas
back in sixty-wan, and the string was the worth of
two ponies in thim days. Three of me mates an'
meself was prospectin' down in western Nebraska.
There came a great blizzard, and Chief Ogalalla
and three of his men rode up to our camp, and we
took them in for the night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>"And he gave you the wampum in payment?"</p>

<p>"Payment? Never! A man never paid for
food nor shelter on the plains. No more than for
the air he breathed. 'Twas gratitude. For Chief
Ogalalla had a ragin' toothache, and I cured it for
him. Made him a poultice of red pepper."</p>

<p>"Mercy! I should think that would hurt worse
than any toothache!"</p>

<p>"Maybe it did, ma'am. But at least it disthracted
his attention from the tooth itself. That
rattlesnake, I kilt in a swamp near Vicksburg.
Me and me wife was young then, and we'd borrowed
a skiff, an' rowed out to hunt pond-lilies.
Mary would go in the bog, walkin' on the big tufts
of rushes. Her little feet were that light she
didn't sink at all. But the first thing I heard she
gave a little squeal, an' there she stood, perched
on a tuft, and not three feet away, curled up on a
log, was that great shinin' serpent. Just rockin'
himself easy, he was, makin' ready to strike. An'
strike he would. Only"&mdash;the small twinkling face
grew grim&mdash;"only I struck first."</p>

<p>Marian shivered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>"And the little white glove?"</p>

<p>The old pilot beamed.</p>

<p>"Sure, I hoped ye'd notice that, miss. That
glove points to the proud day f'r me! It was the
summer of '60. I was pilotin' the <i>Annie Kilburn</i>,
a grand large packet, down to Saint Louis. We
had a wonderful party aboard her. 'Twas just
the beginnin' of war times, an' 'twould be like
readin' a history book aloud to tell ye their names.
Did ever ye hear of the Little Giant?"</p>

<p>"Of Stephen A. Douglas, the famous orator?
Why, yes, to be sure. Was he aboard?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A fine, pleasant-spoke gentleman he was,
too. But 'tis not the Little Giant that this story
is about. 'Twas his wife. Ye've heard of her,
sure? Ah, but I wish you could have seen her
when she came trippin' up the steps of me pilot-house
and passed the time of day with me, so
sweet and friendly. Afterward they told me
what a great lady she was. Though I could see
that for meself, she was that gentle, and her voice
so quiet and low, and her look so sweet and kind.
I was showin' her about, an' feelin' terrible proud,
an' fussy, an' excited. I was a young felly then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
and it took no more than her word an' her smile
to turn me foolish head. An' I was showin' her
how to handle the wheel, and by some mischance,
didn't I catch me blunderin' hand in the frame, an'
give it a wrench that near broke every bone! I
couldn't leave the wheel till the first mate should
come to take me place. And Madame Douglas
was that distressed, you'd think it was her own
hand that she was grievin' over. She would tear
her lace handkerchief into strips, and bind up the
cut, and then what does she do but take her white
glove, an' twist it round the fingers, so's to keep
them from the air, till I could find time to bandage
them. I said not a word. But the minute her
silks an' laces went trailin' down the hurricane
ladder, I jerked off that glove an' folded it in my
wallet. An' there it stayed till I could have that
frame made for it. And in that frame I've carried
it ever since, all these long years.</p>

<p>"Those were the grand days, sure," he added,
wistfully. "Before the war, we pilots were the
lords of the river. I had me a pair of varnished
boots, an' tight striped trousers, an' a grand shiny
stove-pipe hat, an' I wouldn't have called the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
king me uncle. It's sad times for the river, nowadays."
He looked away up the broad, tumbling
yellow stream. "Look at her, will ye! No
river at all, she is, wid her roily yellow water, an'
her poor miry banks, an' her bluffs, all washed
away to shiftin' sand. But wasn't she the grand
stream entirely, before the war!"</p>

<p>Marian looked at the framed river-chart above
the wheel. She tried to read its puzzle of tangled
lines. The old man sniffed.</p>

<p>"Don't waste yer time wid that gimcrack, miss.
Steer by it? Never!" He shrugged his shoulders
loftily. "It hangs there by government request,
so I tolerate it to please the Department. I know
this river by heart, every inch. I could steer this
boat from Natchez to Saint Paul wid me eyes
shut, the blackest night that ever blew!"</p>

<p>Marian dimpled at his majestic tone.</p>

<p>"Will you show me how to steer? I've always
been curious as to how it is done."</p>

<p>"Certain I will."</p>

<p>Keenly interested, Marian gripped the handholds,
and turned the heavy wheel back and forth
as he directed. Suddenly her grasp loosened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Down the stream, straight toward the boat,
drifted a rolling black mass.</p>

<p>"Mercy, what is that? It looks like a whole
forest of logs. It's rolling right toward us!"</p>

<p>"Ye're right. 'Tis a raft that's broke adrift.
But we have time to dodge, be sure. Watch
now."</p>

<p>His right hand grasped the wheel. His left
seized the bell-cord. Three sharp toots signalled
the engine-room for full head of steam. Instantly
the <i>Lucy</i> jarred under Marian's feet with
the sudden heavy force of doubled power. Slowly
the steam-boat swung out of her course, in a long
westward curve. Past her, the nearest logs not
fifty feet away, the great, grinding mass of tree-trunks
rolled and tumbled by, sweeping on toward
the Gulf.</p>

<p>"'Tis handy that we met those gintlemen by
daylight," remarked the pilot, cheerfully. "For
one log alone would foul our paddle-wheels and
give us a bad shaking up. And should all that
Donnybrook Fair come stormin' into us by night,
we'd go to the bottom before ye could say Jack
Robinson."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>Marian's eyes narrowed. She stared at the dusk
stormy yellow river, the blank inhospitable shores.
She was not by any means a coward. But she
could not resist asking one question.</p>

<p>"Do we go on up-river after nightfall? Or do
we stop at some landing?"</p>

<p>"There's no landing between here and Grafton,
at the mouth of the Illinois River. We'll have to
tie up along shore, I'm thinkin'." The old man
spoke grudgingly. "If I was runnin' her meself,
'tis little we'd stop for the night. But the captain
thinks different. He's young and notional.
Tie up over night we must, says he. But 'tis
all nonsense. Chicken-hearted, I'd call it, that's
all."</p>

<p>Marian laughed to herself. Inwardly she was
grateful for the captain's chicken-heartedness.</p>

<p>A loud gong sounded from below. The pilot
nodded.</p>

<p>"Yon's your supper-bell, miss. I thank ye
kindly for the pleasure of yer company. I shall
be honored if ye choose to come again. And
soon."</p>

<p>Marian made her way down to the cabin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
through the stormy dusk. The little room was
warm and brightly lighted; the captain's negro
boy was just placing huge smoking-hot platters of
perfectly cooked fish and steak upon the clean
oil-cloth table. They gathered around it, an odd
company. Marian and Roderick, the captain,
the <i>Lucy's</i> engineer, a pleasant, boyish fellow,
painfully embarrassed and redolent of hot oil and
machinery; and two young dredge-runners, on
their way, like Rod, to the Breckenridge contract.
Save the captain and Rod, they gobbled bashfully,
and fled at the earliest possible moment. Rod
and the captain were talking of the contract and
of its prospects. Marian trifled with her massive
hot biscuit, and listened indifferently.</p>

<p>"I hope your coming on the work may change
its luck, Mr. Hallowell," observed the captain.
"For that contract has struggled with mighty
serious difficulties, so far. Breckenridge himself is
a superb engineer; but of course he cannot stay on
the ground. He has a dozen equally important
contracts to oversee. His engineers are all well
enough, but somehow they don't seem to make
things go. Carlisle is the chief. He is a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
engineer and a good fellow, but he is so nearly
dead with malaria that he can't do two hours' work
in a week. Burford, his aid, is a young Southerner,
a fine chap, but&mdash;well, a bit hot-headed. You
know our Northern labor won't stand for much of
that. Then there is Marvin, who is third in
charge. But as for Marvin"&mdash;he stopped, with
a queer short laugh&mdash;"as for Marvin, the least
said the soonest mended. He's a cub engineer,
they call him; a grizzly cub at that. He may
come out all right, with time. You can see for
yourself that you haven't any soft job. With a
force of two hundred laborers, marooned in a
swamp seven miles from nowhere, not even a railroad
in the county; with half the land-owners
protesting against their assessments, and refusing
to pay up; with your head engineer sick, and
your coal shipments held up by high water&mdash;no,
you won't find your place an easy one, mind
that."</p>

<p>"I'm not doing any worrying." Rod's jaw set.
His dark face glowed. Marian looked at him, a
little jealously. His whole heart and thought
were swinging away to this work, now opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
before him. This was his man's share in labor,
and he was eager to cope with its sternest demands.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a good thing you have the pluck to
face it. You will need all the pluck you've got,
and then some." The captain paced restlessly
up and down the narrow room. "Wonder why we
don't slow down. We must be running a full
twelve miles an hour. Altogether too fast, when
we're towing a barge. And it is pitch dark."</p>

<p>He stooped to the engine-room speaking-tube.
"Hi, Smith! Why are you carrying so much
steam? I want to put her inshore."</p>

<p>A muffled voice rose from the engine-room.</p>

<p>"All right, sir. But McCloskey, he just rung
for full speed ahead."</p>

<p>"He did? That's McCloskey, all over. The
old rascal! He has set his heart on making Grafton
Landing to-night, instead of tying up alongshore.
Hear that? He's making that old wheel
jump. To be sure, he knows the river channel
like a book. But, even with double search-lights,
no man living can see ice-cakes and brush far
enough ahead to dodge them."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's take a look on deck," suggested Rod.</p>

<p>Once outside the warm, cheerful cabin, the night
wind swept down on them, a driving, freezing
blast. The little steamer fairly raced through the
water. Her deck boards quivered; the boom of
the heavy engine throbbed under their feet.</p>

<p>"Thickest night I've seen in a year," growled
the captain. "I say, McCloskey! Slow down,
and let's put her inshore. This is too dangerous
to suit me."</p>

<p>No reply. The boat fled pitching on.</p>

<p>"<i>McCloskey!</i>"</p>

<p>At last there came a faint hail.</p>

<p>"Yes, captain! What's yer pleasure, sir?"</p>

<p>"The old rascal! He's trying to show off. He's
put his deaf ear to the tube, I'll be bound. Best
go inside, Miss Hallowell, this wind is full of
sleet. McCloskey! Head her inshore, I say."</p>

<p>On rushed the <i>Lucy</i>. Her course did not change
a hair's breadth.</p>

<p>"No wonder they call him Commodore McCloskey!"
Rod whispered wickedly. "Even the
captain has to yield to him."</p>

<p>"McCloskey!" The captain's voice was gruff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
with anger. "<i>Head her inshore!</i> Unless you're
trying to kill the boat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>The captain's sentence was never finished.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
ENTER MR. FINNEGAN</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>With that crash the floor shot from under their
feet. Stumbling and clutching, the three, Marian,
Rod, and the captain, pitched across the deck and
landed in a heap against the rail. The lighted
cabin seemed to rear straight up from the deck
and lunge toward them. There was an uproar of
shouts, a hideous pounding of machinery. Marian
shut her eyes.</p>

<p>Then, with a second deafening crash, the
steamer righted herself; and, thrown like three
helpless ninepins, Marian, Rod, and the captain
reeled back from the rail and found themselves,
bumped and dizzy, tangled in a heap of freight
and canvas. Rod was the first on his feet. He
snatched Marian up, with a groan.</p>

<p>"Sister! Are you hurt? Tell me, quick."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, no." Marian struggled up, bruised
and trembling. "I whacked my head on the rail,
that's all. What has happened?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"We've struck another bunch of runaway logs.
They've fouled our wheel," shouted the captain.
"Put this life-preserver on your sister. Swing out
the yawl, boys!" For the deck crew was already
scrambling up the stairs. "Here, where's Smith?"</p>

<p>"He's below, sir, stayin' by the boiler. The
logs struck us for'ard the gangway. She's got a
hole stove in her that you could drive an ice-wagon
through," answered a fireman. "Smith says, head
her inshore. Maybe you can beach her before she
goes clean under."</p>

<p>The captain groaned.</p>

<p>"Her first trip for the year! The smartest little
boat on the river! McCloskey!" he shouted
angrily up the tube. "Head her inshore, before
she's swamped. You hear that, I reckon?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir." It was a very meek voice down
the tube.</p>

<p>Very slowly the <i>Lucy</i> swung about. Creaking
and groaning, she headed through the darkness
for the darker line of willows that masked the
Illinois shore.</p>

<p>For a minute, Roderick and Marian stood together
under the swaying lantern, too dazed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
excitement to move. On Marian's forehead a
cheerful blue bump had begun to rise; while
Rod's cheek-bone displayed an ugly bruise. Suddenly
Marian spoke.</p>

<p>"Rod! Where is Empress! She will be frightened
to death. We must take her into the yawl
with us."</p>

<p>The young fireman turned.</p>

<p>"That grand big cat of yours, ma'am? You'll
never coax a cat into an open boat. They'll die
first. But have no fear. We are not a hundred
yards from shore, and in shallow water at that.
'Tis a pity the <i>Lucy</i> is hurt, but it's fortunate for
us that she can limp ashore."</p>

<p>Marian felt a little foolish. She pulled off the
cork jacket which Rod had tied over her shoulders.</p>

<p>"We aren't shipwrecked after all, Rod. We're
worse frightened than hurt."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that. Keep that life-preserver
on, Sis."</p>

<p>The <i>Lucy</i> was blundering pluckily toward shore.
But the deck jarred with the thud and rattle of
thrashing machinery, and at every forward plunge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the boat pitched until it seemed as if the next fling
would surely capsize her.</p>

<p>Rod peered into the darkness.</p>

<p>"We'll make the shore, I do believe. Shall I
leave you long enough to get our bags and Empress?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll go too. You'll need me to pacify
Empress. She will be panic-stricken."</p>

<p>Poor Empress was panic-stricken, indeed. The
little cabin was a chaos. The shock of the collision
had overturned every piece of furniture.
Even the wall cabinets were upset, and their shells
and arrowheads were scattered far and wide. The
beautiful old-time crystal chandeliers were in
splinters. Worst, the big gilt mirror lay on the
floor, smashed to atoms. Only one object in all
that cabin held its place: the stuffed eagle. And
high on the eagle's outspread wing, crouched like
a panther, snarling and spitting, her every silky
hair furiously on end, clung poor, terrified Empress.
Rod exploded.</p>

<p>"You made friends with the nice bird, after
all, didn't you, Empress! Come on down, kitty.
Let me put a life-preserver on you too."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>No life-preservers for Empress! Marian coaxed
and called in vain. She merely dug her claws
into the eagle's back and growled indignant
refusal.</p>

<p>"Let's go back on deck, Sis. She'll calm down
presently."</p>

<p>The <i>Lucy</i> was now working inshore with increasing
speed. But, as they stepped on deck,
the boat careened suddenly, then stopped, with
a sickening jolt.</p>

<p>"Never mind, miss," the young fireman
quickly assured her. "She has struck a sand-bar,
and there she'll stick, I fear. But we are safe
enough, for the water is barely six feet deep.
We'll have to anchor here for the night, but don't
be nervous. She can't sink very far in six feet of
water."</p>

<p>"I suppose not." Yet Marian's teeth chattered.
Inwardly she sympathized with Empress.
What a comfort it would be to climb the stuffed
eagle and perch there, well out of reach of even
six feet of black icy water!</p>

<p>The captain was still more reassuring.</p>

<p>"Well, we're lucky that we've brought her this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
near shore." He wiped his forehead with a rather
unsteady hand. "Ten minutes ago my heart was
in my mouth. I thought sure she'd sink in mid-stream.
You're perfectly safe now, Miss Hallowell.
Better go to your state-room and get some
sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes, the <i>Lucy</i> will rest still as a church now,"
said the young fireman, with a heartening chuckle.
"She's hard aground. Though that's no thanks
to our pilot. I say, McCloskey! Where were you
trying to steer us? Into a lumber-yard?"</p>

<p>Down the hurricane deck came Mr. McCloskey,
white beard waving, eyes twinkling, jaunty and
serene as a May morning.</p>

<p>"This little incident is no fault of me steerin',"
said he, with delightful unconcern. "'Twas the
carelessness of thim raftsmen, letting their logs
get away, no less. Sure, captain dear, I'd sue
them for damages."</p>

<p>"I'll be more likely to sue you for running full
speed after dark, against orders," muttered the
captain. Then he laughed. "I ought to put you
in irons. But the man doesn't live that can hold
a grudge against you, McCloskey. Take hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
now, boys. Bank your fires, then we'll patch her
up as best we can for the night."</p>

<p>Marian went to her state-room, but not to sleep.
There was little sleep that night for anybody. In
spite of protecting sand-bar and anchor, the boat
careened wretchedly. Strange groans and shrieks
rose from the engine-room; hurrying footsteps
came and went through the narrow gangway.
And the rush of the swift current, the bump of
ice-cakes, and the sweep of floating brush past her
window kept her aroused and trembling. It
seemed years before the tiny window grew gray
with dawn.</p>

<p>The captain's voice reached her ears.</p>

<p>"No, the <i>Lucy</i> isn't damaged as badly as we
thought. But it will take us two days of bulkheading
before we dare go on. You'd best take
your sister up to the camp in my launch. It is
at your service."</p>

<p>"That's good news!" sighed Marian. "Anything
to escape from this sinking ship. I don't
like playing Casabianca one bit."</p>

<p>She swallowed the hot coffee and corn bread
which the captain's boy brought to her door, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
hurried on deck. Their embarking was highly
exciting; for poor Empress, having been coaxed
with difficulty from the eagle's roost, where she
had spent the night, promptly lost her head at
sight of the water and fled shrieking to the pilot-house.
Rod, the pilot, the engineer, and the
young fireman together hunted her from her fastness,
and, after a wild chase, returned scratched
but victorious, with Empress raging in a gunny-sack.</p>

<p>"Best keep her there till you're ashore, miss,"
laughed the young fireman. And Marian took
the precaution to tie the mouth of the sack with
double knots.</p>

<p>Up-stream puffed the launch, past Grafton
Landing into the narrower but clearer current of
the Illinois River. Now the black mud banks
rose into bluffs and wooded hills. Here and there
a marshy backwater showed a faint tinge of early
green. But there was not a village in sight; not
even a solitary farm-house. Hour after hour they
steamed slowly up the dull river, beneath the gray
mist-hooded sky. Marian looked resentfully at
her brother. He had unrolled a portfolio of blue-prints,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
and sat over them, as absorbed and as indifferent
to the cold and discomfort as if he were
sitting at his own desk at home.</p>

<p>"He's so rapt over his miserable old contract
that he is not giving me one thought," Marian
sulked to herself. "I just wish that I had put my
foot down, and had refused, flatly, to come with
him. If I had dreamed the West would be like
this!"</p>

<p>Presently the launch whistled. An answering
whistle came from up-stream. Rod dropped his
blue-prints with a shout.</p>

<p>"Look, Marian. There is the contract camp,
the whole plant! See, straight ahead!"</p>

<p>Marian stared. There was not a house to be
seen; but high on the right bank stood an army
of tents; and below, moored close to shore, lay
a whole village of boats, strung in long double file.
Midway stood a gigantic steam-dredge. Its vivid
red-painted machinery reared high on its black,
oil-soaked platform, its strange sprawling crane
spread its iron wings, like the pinions of some vast
ungainly bird of prey. Around it were ranked
several flat-boats, a trim steam-launch, a whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
regiment of house-boats. Rod's eyes sparkled.
He drew a sharp breath.</p>

<p>"This is my job, all right. Isn't it sumptuous,
Marian! Will you look at that dredge! Isn't
she magnificent? So is the whole outfit, barges
and all. That's worth walking from Boston to
see!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" Marian choked back the vicious little
retort. "Well, I'd be willing to walk back to
Boston&mdash;to get away!"</p>

<p>"Ahoy the launch! This is Mr. Hallowell?"
A tall, haggard man in oilskins and hip boots came
striding across the dredge. "Glad to see you, sir.
We hoped that you would arrive to-day. I am
Carlisle, the engineer in charge." He leaned over
the rail to give Rod's hand a friendly grip. He
spoke with a dry, formal manner, yet his lean yellow
face was full of kindly interest. "And this is
your sister, Miss Hallowell? You have come to a
rather forlorn summer resort, Miss Hallowell, but
we will do our best to make it endurable for
you."</p>

<p>Roderick, red with pleasure, stood up to greet
his new chief. Behind Mr. Carlisle towered a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
broad-shouldered, heavily built young man, in
very muddy khaki and leggings, his blond wind-burnt
face shining with a hospitable grin.</p>

<p>"This is our Mr. Burford, Mr. Hallowell. At
present, you and he will superintend the night
shifts."</p>

<p>Mr. Burford gave Roderick a hearty handshake,
and beamed upon Marian.</p>

<p>"Mr. Burford will be particularly glad to welcome
you, Miss Hallowell, on Mrs. Burford's account.
She has been living here on the work for
several months, the only lady who has graced our
camp until to-day. I know that she will be eager
for your companionship."</p>

<p>Mr. Burford grew fairly radiant.</p>

<p>"Sally Lou will be wild when she learns that you
are really here," he declared eagerly, in his deep
southern drawl. "She has talked of your coming
every minute since the news came that we might
hope to have you with us. You will find us a
mighty primitive set, but you and Sally Lou can
have plenty of fun together, I know. I'd like to
bring her and the kiddies to see you as soon as you
feel equal to receiving us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you very much." Marian tried her
best to be gracious and friendly. But she was so
tired that young Burford's broad smiling face
seemed to blur and waver through a thickening
mist. "I'm sure I shall be charmed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hi, there!" An angry shout broke upon her
words. "Mr. Carlisle, will you look here! That
foreman of yours has gone off with my skiff again.
If I'm obliged to share my boat with your impudent
riffraff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Marvin, will you kindly come here a
moment?" The chief's voice did not lose its even
tone; but his heavy brows narrowed. "I wish
you to meet Mr. Hallowell, who is your and Mr.
Burford's new associate. Miss Hallowell, may I
present Mr. Marvin?"</p>

<p>Marian bowed and looked curiously at the tall,
dark-featured young man who shuffled forward.
She remembered the captain's terse description&mdash;"a
cub engineer, and a grizzly cub at that." Mr.
Marvin certainly acted the part. He barely
nodded to her and to Roderick, then clamored on
with his grievance.</p>

<p>"You know I've told the men time and again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
to leave my boat alone. But your foreman borrows
my launch whenever he takes the notion,
and leaves her half-swamped, or high and dry, as
he chooses. If you won't jack him up for it, I
will. I'll not tolerate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll take that matter up later, Mr. Marvin."
Marvin's sullen face reddened at the tone in his
chief's voice. "Mr. Hallowell, I have found
lodgings for your sister three miles up the canal,
at the Gates farm. Mr. Burford will take you to
Gates's Landing, thence you will drive to the farm-house.
Your own quarters will be on the engineers'
house-boat, and we shall hope to see you
here for dinner to-night. Good-by, Miss Hallowell.
I hope that Mrs. Gates will do everything
to make you comfortable."</p>

<p>The launch puffed away up the narrow muddy
canal. It was a straight, deep stream of brown
water, barely forty feet wide. Its banks were a
high-piled mass of mire and clay, for the levee-builders
had not yet begun work. Beyond rose
clumps of leafless trees. Then, far as eye could
see, muddy fields and gray swampy meadows.
Rod gazed, radiant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't it splendid, Marian! The finest equipment
I ever dreamed of. Look at those barges!"</p>

<p>"Those horrid flat-boats heaped with coal?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Think of the yardage record we're making.
Five thousand yards a day!"</p>

<p>Marian rubbed her aching eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know a yardage record from a bushel
basket," she sighed. "What is that queer box-shaped
red boat, set on a floating platform?"</p>

<p>"That is the engineers' house-boat, where your
brother is to live. Mayn't we take you aboard to
see?" urged Burford.</p>

<p>Marian stepped on the narrow platform and
peered into the cubby-hole state-rooms and the
clean, scoured mess-room. She was too tired to
be really interested.</p>

<p>"And that funny, grass-green cabin, set on
wooden stilts, up that little hill&mdash;that play-house?"</p>

<p>Burford laughed.</p>

<p>"That's my play-house. Sally Lou insists on
living right here, so that she and the babies and
Mammy Easter can keep a watchful eye on me.
You and Sally Lou will be regular chums, I know.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
She is not more than a year or so older than you
are, and it has been pretty rough on her to leave
her home and come down here. But she says she
doesn't care; that she'd rather rough it down here
with me than mope around home, back in Norfolk,
without me. It surely is a splendid scheme
for me to have her here." He laughed again,
with shy, boyish pride. "Sally Lou is a pretty
plucky sort. And, if I may say it, so are you."</p>

<p>Marian managed to smile her thanks. Inwardly
she was hoping that the marvellous Sally
Lou would stay away and leave her in peace. She
was trembling with fatigue. Through the rest of
the trip she hardly spoke.</p>

<p>At Gates's Landing they were met by a solemn,
bashful youth and a buckboard drawn by two
raw, excited horses. They whirled and bumped
through a rutted woods road and stopped at last
before a low white farm-house. Marian realized
dimly that Rod was carrying her upstairs and into
a small tidy room. She was so utterly tired that
she dropped on the bed and slept straight through
the day.</p>

<p>She did not waken until her landlady's tap called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
her to supper. Mr. and Mrs. Gates, two quiet,
elderly people, greeted her kindly, and set a
Homeric feast before her: shortbread and honey,
broiled squirrels and pigeon stew, persimmon jam
and hot mince pie. She ate dutifully, then crept
back to her little room, with its mournful hair
wreaths and its yellowed engravings of "Night
and Morning" and "The Death-bed of Washington,"
and fell asleep again.</p>

<p>The three days that followed were like a queer,
tired dream. It rained night and day. The
roads were mired hub deep. Roderick could not
drive over to see her, but he telephoned to her
daily. But his hasty messages were little satisfaction.
The heavy rains had overflowed the big
ditch, he told her. That meant extra work for
everybody on the plant. Carlisle was wretchedly
sick, so Rod and Burford were sharing their chief's
watch in addition to their own duties. Worst,
Marvin had quarrelled with the head runner of the
big dredge, and "We're having to spend half our
time in coddling them both for fear they'll walk
off and leave us," as Rod put it. In short, Roderick
had neither time nor thought for his sister.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Marian realized that her brother was not inconsiderate.
He was absorbed in his work and in
its risks. Yet she keenly resented her loneliness.</p>

<p>"It isn't Rod's fault. But if I had dreamed that
the West would be like this!"</p>

<p>But on the fourth day, while she sat at her window
looking out at the endless rain, there came
a surprising diversion.</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, Miss Hallowell.
Will you come downstairs?"</p>

<p>"Why, Commodore McCloskey!" Marian hurried
down, delighted. "How good of you to
come!"</p>

<p>Commodore McCloskey, dripping from his
sou'wester to his mired boots, beamed like a
drenched but cheery Santa Claus.</p>

<p>"I've taken the liberty to bring a friend to call,"
he chuckled. "He's young an' green, an' 'tis
few manners he owns, but he's good stock, an'&mdash;Here,
ye rascal! Shame on ye, startin' a fight
the minute ye enter the house!"</p>

<p>Marian gasped. Past her, with a wild miauw,
shot a yellow streak. That streak was Empress.
Straight after the streak flew a fat, brown, curly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
object, yapping at the top of its powerful lungs.
Up the window-curtain scrambled Empress.
With a frantic leap she landed on the frame of
Grandpa Gates's large crayon portrait. Beneath
the portrait her curly pursuer yelped and whined.</p>

<p>"Why, he's a collie puppy. Oh, what a beauty!
What is his name?"</p>

<p>"Beauty he is. And his name is Finnegan,
after the poem, 'Off again, on again, gone again,
Finnegan.' Do ye remember? 'Tis him to the
life. He is a prisint to ye from Missis McCloskey
and meself. An' our compliments an' good wishes
go wid him!"</p>

<p>"How more than kind of you!" Marian, delighted,
stooped to pat her new treasure. Finnegan
promptly leaped on her and spattered her
fresh dress with eager, muddy paws. He then
caught the table-cover in his teeth. With one
frisky bounce he brought a shower of books and
magazines to the floor. Mr. McCloskey clutched
for his collar. The puppy gayly eluded him and
made a dash for the pantry. Marian caught him
just as he was diving headlong into the open
flour-barrel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"I do thank you so much! He'll be such a
pleasure; and such a protection," gasped Marian,
snatching Mrs. Gates's knitting work from the
puppy's inquiring paws.</p>

<p>"'Tis hardly a protector I'd call him," Mr. McCloskey
returned. "But he'll sure keep your mind
employed some. Good-day to ye, ma'am. And
good luck with Finnegan."</p>

<p>Poor Empress! In her delight with this new
plaything, Marian quite forgot her elder companion.
Moreover, as Mr. McCloskey had said,
Finnegan could and did keep her mind employed,
and her hands as well.</p>

<p>"That pup is energetic enough, but he don't
appear to have much judgment," said Mrs. Gates,
mildly. In two hours Finnegan had carried off
the family supply of rubbers and hid them in the
corn-crib; he had torn up one of Rod's blue-prints;
he had terrorized the hen-yard; he had chased
Empress from turret to foundation-stone. At
length Empress had turned on him and cuffed
him till he yelped and fled to the kitchen, where he
upset a pan of bread sponge.</p>

<p>"Suppose you take him for a walk, down to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the big ditch. Maybe the fresh air will calm
him down."</p>

<p>Marian made a leash of clothes-line and marched
Finnegan down the sodden woods toward the
ditch. She was so busy laughing at his droll performances
that she quite forgot the dull fields, the
wet, gray prospect. Crimson-cheeked and breathless,
she finally dragged him from the third alluring
rabbit-hole, despite his pleading whines,
and started back up the canal. As she pushed
through a hedge of willows a sweet, high, laughing
voice accosted her.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, my haughty lady! Won't you
stop and talk with us a while?"</p>

<p>Startled, Marian turned toward the call. Across
the ditch, high on the opposite bank, stood the
quaintest, prettiest group that her eyes had ever
beheld. A tall, fair-haired girl of her own age,
dressed in a bewitching short-waisted gown of
scarlet and a frilly scarlet bonnet, stood in the
leafless willows, a tiny white-clad child in her arms.
Behind her a stout beaming negress in bandanna
turban and gay plaid calico was lifting another
baby high on her ample shoulder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>Marian stared, astonished. The whole group
might well have stepped straight out of some
captivating old engraving of the days before the
war.</p>

<p>"Haven't you time to pass the time o' day?"
the sweet, mischievous voice entreated. "You
are Miss Hallowell, I know. I'm Sarah Louisiana
Burford, and I am just perishin' to meet you.
There is a board bridge just a rod or so up the
canal. We'll meet you there. Do please come,
and bring your delightful dog. March right along
now!"</p>

<p>And Marian, laughing with amusement and delight,
marched obediently along.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
THE MARTIN-BOX NEIGHBORS</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>Marian picked her way up the shore to the
board bridge, with Finnegan prancing behind her.
She felt a little abashed as she remembered her
rather tart indifference to young Burford's cordial
invitation of the week before. But all her embarrassment
melted away as she crossed the little
bridge and met Sally Lou's welcoming face, her
warm clasping hands.</p>

<p>"You don't know how hungry I have been to
see you," vowed Sally Lou, her brown eyes kindling
under the scarlet bonnet.</p>

<p>"We've been counting the hours till we should
dare to go to call on Miss Northerner, haven't we,
kiddies? This is my son, Edward Fairfax Burford,
Junior, Miss Hallowell. Three years old,
three feet square, and weighs forty-one pounds.
Isn't he rather gorgeous&mdash;if he does belong to me!
And this is Thomas Tucker Burford. Eighteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
months old, twenty-six pounds, and the disposition
of an angel, as long as he gets his own way.
And this is Mammy Easter, who came all the way
from Norfolk with me, to take care of the babies,
so that I could live here on the contract with Ned.
Wasn't she brave to come out to this cold, lonesome
country all for me? And this martin-box
is my house, and it is anxious to meet you, too, so
come right in!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="illo2" id="illo2"></a>
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="372" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ON THE EDGE OF THE OPPOSITE BANK STOOD THE QUAINTEST,
PRETTIEST GROUP THAT HER EYES HAD EVER BEHELD.</p>
</div>

<p>Marian climbed the high, narrow outside steps
that led to the tiny play-house on stilts, and
entered the low, red doorway, feeling as if she had
climbed Jack's bean-stalk into fairyland. Inside,
the martin-box was even more fascinating. It
boasted just three rooms. The largest room, gay
with Mother Goose wall-paper and rosy chintz,
was obviously the realm of Edward, Junior, and
Thomas Tucker. The next room, with its cunning
miniature fireplace, its shelves of books, its
pictures and photographs, and its broad high-piled
desk, was their parents' abode; while the
third room boasted fascinating white-painted cupboards
and sink, a tiny alcohol stove, and a wee
table daintily set.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>"Aren't you shocked at folks that eat in their
kitchen?" drawled Sally Lou, observing Marian
with dancing eyes. "But all our baking and heavy
cooking is done for us, over on the quarter-boat.
I brought the stove to heat the babies' milk; and,
too, I like to fuss up goodies for Ned when he is
tired or worried. Poor boys! They're having
such an exasperating time with the contract this
week! Everything seems possessed to go awry.
We'll have to see to it that they get a lot of coddling
so's to keep them cheered up, won't we?"</p>

<p>"Why, I&mdash;I suppose so. But how did you dare
to bring your little children down here? They say
that this is the most malarial district in the State."</p>

<p>"I know. But they can't catch malaria until
May, when the mosquitoes come. Then I shall
send them to a farm, back in the higher land.
Mammy will take care of them; and I'll stay down
here with Ned during the day and go to the babies
at night. They're pretty sturdy little tads.
They are not likely to catch anything unless
their mother is careless with them. And she isn't
careless, really. Is she, Tom Tucker?" She
snatched up her youngest son, with a hug that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
made his fat ribs creak. "Come, now! Let's
brew some stylish afternoon tea for the lady.
Get down the caravan tea that father sent us,
Mammy, and the preserved ginger, and my
Georgian spoons. And fix some chicken bones
on the stoop for Miss Northerner's puppy. This
is going to be a banquet, and a right frabjous
one, too!"</p>

<p>It was a banquet, and a frabjous one, Marian
agreed. Sally Lou's tea and Mammy's nut-cakes
were delicious beyond words. The bright little
house, the dainty service, Sally Lou's charming
gay talk, the babies, clinging wide-eyed and
adorable to her knee, all warmed and heartened
Marian's listless soul. She was ravished with
everything. She looked in wonder and delight
at the high sleeping-porch, with its double mosquito
bars and its duck screening and its cosey
hammock-beds. ("Ned sleeps so much better
here, where it is quiet, than on that noisy boat,"
Sally Lou explained.) She gazed with deep respect
at the tiny pantry, built of soap-boxes, lined
with snowy oil-cloth. She marvelled at the exquisite
old silver, the fine embroidered table-linen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the delicate china. And she caught her
breath when her eyes lighted upon the beautiful
painting in oils that hung above young Burford's
desk. It was a magical bit of color: a dreamy
Italian garden, walled in ancient carved and mellowed
stone, its slopes and borders a glory of
roses, flaunting in splendid bloom; and past its
flowery gates, a glimpse of blue, calm sea. She
could hardly turn her eyes away from the lovely
vista. It was as restful as an April breeze. And
across the lower corner she read the clear tracing
of the signature, a world-famous name.</p>

<p>Sally Lou followed her glance.</p>

<p>"You surely think I'm a goose, don't you, to
bring my gold teaspoons, and my wedding linen,
and my finest tea-set down to a wilderness like
this? Well, perhaps I am. And yet the very best
treasures that we own are none too good for our
home, you know. And this <i>is</i> home. Any place
is home when Ned and the babies and I are together.
Besides, the very fact that this place is
so queer and ugly and dismal is the best of reasons
why we need all our prettiest things, and need to
use them every day, don't you see? So I picked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
out my sacredest treasures to bring along. And
that painting&mdash;yes, it was running a risk to
bring so valuable a canvas down here. But
doesn't it just rest your heart to look at it? That
is why I wanted it with us every minute. You
can look at that blue sleepy sky, and those roses
climbing the garden wall, and the sea below, and
forget all about the noisy, grimy boats, and the
mud, and sleet, and malaria, and the cross laborers,
and the broken machinery, and everything else;
and just look, and look, and dream. That is why
I carted it along. Especially on Ned's account,
don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes." At last Marian took her wistful
eyes from the picture. "I wish that I had thought
to bring some good photographs to hang in Rod's
state-room. I never thought. But there is no
room to pin up even a picture post-card in his
cubby-hole on the boat. I must go on now. I
have had a beautiful time."</p>

<p>"There goes your brother this minute! In that
little red launch, see? He is going up the ditch.
Ring the dinner-bell, Mammy, that will stop him.
He can take you and your dog up to Gates's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Landing and save you half an hour's muddy
walk."</p>

<p>Mammy's dinner-bell pealed loud alarm. Roderick
heard and swung the boat right-about. His
sober, anxious face lighted as Marian and Sally
Lou gayly hailed him.</p>

<p>"I'm glad that you've met Mrs. Burford," he
said, as he helped Marian aboard and hoisted
Finnegan astern with some difficulty and many
yelps; for Finnegan left his chicken-bones only
under forcible urging. "She is just about the
best ever, and I hope you two will be regular
chums."</p>

<p>"I love her this minute," declared Marian, with
enthusiasm. "Where are you bound, Rod?
Mayn't Finnegan and I tag along?"</p>

<p>Rod's face grew worried.</p>

<p>"I'm bound upon a mighty ticklish cruise, Sis.
It is a ridiculous cruise, too. Do you remember
what I told you last week about the law that
governs the taxing of the land-owners for the making
of these ditches?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You said that when the majority of the
land-owners had agreed on doing the drainage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
work, then the law made every owner pay his tax,
in proportion to the acreage of his land which
would be drained by the ditches, whether he
himself wanted the drainage done or not. And
you said that some of the farmers did not want the
ditches dug, and that they were holding back their
payments and making trouble for the contractors;
while others were making still more trouble by
blocking the right of way and refusing to let the
dredges cut through their land. But how can they
hold you back, Rod? The law says that all the
district people must share in the drainage expenses,
whether they like to or not, because the
majority of their neighbors have agreed upon it."</p>

<p>"The law says exactly that. Yes. But there
are a lot of kinks to drainage law, and the farmers
know it. Burford says that two or three of them
have been making things lively for the company
from the start. But just now we have only one
troublesome customer to deal with. And she is a
woman, that is the worst of it. She is a well-to-do,
eccentric old lady, who owns a splendid farm,
just beyond the Gateses. She paid her drainage
assessment willingly enough. But now she says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
that, last fall, the boys who made the survey
tramped through her watermelon-field and broke
some vines and sneaked off with three melons.
At least, so she indignantly states. Maybe it is
so; although the boys swear it was a pumpkin-field,
and that they didn't steal so much as a jack-o'-lantern.
Furthermore, she has put up barb wire
and trespass notices straight across the contract
right of way; and she has sent us notice that she
is guarding that right of way with a gun, and
that the first engineer who pokes his nose across
her boundary line is due to receive a full charge
of buckshot. Sort of a shot-gun quarantine, see?
Now we must start dredging the lateral that
crosses her land next Monday, at the latest. It
must be done at the present stage of high water,
else we'll have to delay dredging it until fall. Carlisle
planned to call on her to-day, and to mollify
her if possible, but he's too sick. So I must elbow
in myself, and see what my shirt-sleeve diplomacy
can do. I'm glad that I can take you along. Perhaps
you can help to thaw her out."</p>

<p>"Of all the weird calls to make! What is the
old lady like, Rod?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>"Burford says that she is a droll character. She
has managed her own farm for forty years, and
has made a fine success of it. Her name is Mrs.
Chrisenberry. She is not educated, but she is
very capable, and very kind-hearted when you
once get on the right side of her. Yonder is her
landing. Don't look so scared, Sis. She won't
eat you."</p>

<p>Marian's fear dissolved in giggles as they teetered
up the narrow board walk to the low brick
farm-house. They could not find a door-bell;
they rapped and pounded until their knuckles
ached. Finnegan yapped helpfully and chewed
the husk door-mat. At last, a forbidding voice
sounded from the rear of the house.</p>

<p>"You needn't bang my door down. Come
round to the dryin' yard, unless you're agents.
If you're agents, you needn't come at all. I'm
busy."</p>

<p>Meekly Rod and Marian followed this hospitable
summons.</p>

<p>Across the muddy drying yard stretched rows
of clothes-line, fluttering white. Beside a heaped
basket of wet, snowy linen stood a very short,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
very stout little old lady, her thick woollen skirts
tucked up under a spotless white apron, her small
nut-cracker face glowering from under a sun-bonnet
almost as large as herself. She took three
clothes-pins from her mouth and scowled at Rod.</p>

<p>"Well!" said she. "Name your business. But
I don't want no graphophones, nor patent chick-feed,
nor golden-oak dinin'-room sets, nor Gems of
Poesy with gilt edges. Mind that."</p>

<p>Marian choked. Rod knew that choke. Tears
of strangling laughter stood in his eyes as he humbly
stuttered his errand.</p>

<p>"W-we engineers of the Breckenridge Company
wish to offer our sincere apologies for any annoyance
that our surveyors may have caused you.
We are anxious to make any reparation that we
can. And&mdash;er&mdash;we find ourselves obliged, on
account of the high water, to cut our east laterals
at once. We will be very grateful to you if you
will be so kind as to overlook our trespasses of last
season, and will permit us to go on with our work.
I speak for the company as well as for myself."</p>

<p>The old lady stared at him, with unwinking,
beady eyes. There was a painful pause.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. You're a powerful slick,
soft-spoken young man. I'll say that much for
you." Marian gulped, and stooped hurriedly to
pat Finnegan. "And I don't know as I have any
lastin' gredge against your company. Them melons
was frost-bit, anyway. But if you do start
your machinery on that lateral, mind I don't want
no more tamperin' with my garden stuff. And
I don't want your men a-cavortin' around, runnin'
races on my land, nor larkin' evenings, nor
comin' to the house for drinks of water. One of
them surveyors, last fall, he come to the door
for a drink, an' I was fryin' crullers, an' he asked
for one, bold as brass. Says I, 'Help yourself.'
Well, he did that. There was a blue platter
brim full, and if he didn't set down an' eat every
single cruller, down to the last crumb! An' then
he had the impudence to tell me to my face that
they was tolerable good crullers, but that he'd
wager the next platterful would taste better than
the first, an' he'd like to try and find out for
sure!"</p>

<p>"I don't blame him. I'd like to try that experiment
myself," said Rod serenely. The old lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
glared. Then the ghost of a twinkle flickered
under the vasty sun-bonnet.</p>

<p>"Well, as I say, I ain't made up my mind yet.
But I'll let you know to-night, maybe. Now
you'd better be goin'. Looks like more rain."</p>

<p>"Can't we help you with the clothes first?"
asked Marian. The old lady shook out a huge,
wet table-cloth and stood on tip-toe to pin it
carefully on the line.</p>

<p>"You might, yes. Take these pillow-cases.
But don't you drop them in the mud. My
clothes-line broke down last week, and didn't I
spend a day of it, doin' my whole week's wash
over again!"</p>

<p>The strong breeze caught the big cloth and
whipped it like a banner. Finnegan, who had
been waiting politely in the background, beheld
this signal with joy. With a gay yelp he bolted
past Marian and seized a corner of the table-cloth
in his teeth.</p>

<p>"Scat!" cried Mrs. Chrisenberry, startled.
"Where did that pup come from? Shoo!"</p>

<p>Finnegan, unheeding, took a tighter grip, and
swung his fat heavy body from the ground. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
was a sickening sound of tearing linen. Marian
stood transfixed. Rod, his arms full of wet pillow-slips,
dashed to the rescue. But he was not in
time.</p>

<p>"Scat, I say!" Mrs. Chrisenberry flapped her
apron.</p>

<p>Amiable creature, she wanted to play with him!
Enchanted, the puppy let go the table-cloth and
dashed at her, under full steam. His sturdy paws
struck Mrs. Chrisenberry with the force of a
young battering-ram. With an astonished shriek
she swayed back, clutching at the table-cloth to
steady herself. But the table-cloth and clothes-pins
could not hold a moment against the onslaught
of the heavy puppy. By good fortune,
the basketful of clothes stood directly behind Mrs.
Chrisenberry. As the faithless table-cloth slid
from the rope, back she pitched, with a terrified
squeal, to land, safely if forcibly, in its snowy
depths.</p>

<p>Marian, quite past speech, sank on the porch
steps. Rod stood gaping with horror. Mrs.
Chrisenberry rose up with appalling calm.</p>

<p>"You! You come here. You&mdash;varmint!"</p>

<p>Finnegan did not hesitate. Trustfully he gambolled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
up; gayly he seized her apron hem in his
white milk teeth and bit out a feather-stitched
scallop. Mrs. Chrisenberry stooped. Her broad
palm landed heavily on Finnegan's curly ear.</p>

<p>Alas for discipline! Finnegan dodged back and
eyed her, amazed. One grieved yelp rent the air.
Then, instantly repenting, he leaped upon her
and smothered her with muddy kisses. This was
merely the lady's way of playing with him. How
could he resent it!</p>

<p>Then Rod came to his wits. He seized Mr.
Finnegan by the collar and cuffed him into bewildered
silence. He caught up the wrecked table-cloth
and the miry pillow-slips, he poured out
regrets and apologies and promises in an all but
tearful stream. Mrs. Chrisenberry did not say
one word. Her small nut-cracker face set, ominous.</p>

<p>"You needn't waste no more soft sawder," said
she, at length. "I 'low these are just the rampagin'
doings I could look for every day if I once
gave you folks permission to bring your dredge
on my land. So I may's well make up my mind
right now. Tell your boss that those trespass
signs an' that barb wire are still up, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
they'll most likely stay up till doomsday. Good-mornin'."</p>

<p>"Well! I don't give much for my shirt-sleeve
diplomacy," groaned Rod, as they teetered away,
down the board walk.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Rod." Then Marian choked again.
Weak with laughter, she clung to the gate-post.
"It was j-just like a moving picture! And when
she vanished into the basket&mdash;Oh, dear&mdash;oh,
dear!"</p>

<p>"You better believe it was exactly like a moving
picture," muttered Rod. "It all went so fast I
couldn't get there in time to do one thing. It
went like a cinematograph&mdash;Zip! And off flew
all our chances for all time. Finnegan, you scoundrel!
Do you realize that your playful little game
will cost the company a lawsuit and a small fortune
besides?"</p>

<p>Finnegan barked and took a friendly nip of
Rod's ankle. Finnegan's young conscience was
crystal-clear.</p>

<p>"Let's take the launch down to Burford's and
tell them our misfortunes," said Rod. "I need
sympathy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>The Burfords heard their mournful tale with
shouts of unpitying joy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, it's hard luck. Especially with
Marvin in the sulks and Carlisle sick," said Ned
Burford, wiping his eyes. "But the next time
you start diplomatic negotiations, you had better
leave that dog at home. I'm going over to the
house-boat to tell Mr. Carlisle. Poor sick fellow,
this story will amuse him if anything can."</p>

<p>He jumped into the launch. A minute later
Rod brought it alongside the house-boat and Burford
disappeared within.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carlisle, sir!" They heard his laughing
voice at the chief's state-room door. "May I
come in? Will I disturb you if I tell you a good
joke on Hallowell?"</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then came a rush of feet.
Burford dashed from the cabin and confronted
Rod and Marian. His face was very white.</p>

<p>"Hallowell! Come aboard, quick!" he said,
in a shaking voice. "Mr. Carlisle is terribly ill.
He's lying there looking like death; he couldn't
even speak to me. Hurry!"
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
GOOSE-GREASE AND DIPLOMACY</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>Roderick leaped aboard. Marian followed,
trembling with fear.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlisle lay in his seaman's hammock beside
the window. His gaunt hands were like ice.
His lean face was ashen gray. But he nodded
weakly and put out a shaking, courteous hand.</p>

<p>"Too bad to alarm you thus," he gasped. "I&mdash;I
was afraid of this. Malaria plays ugly tricks
with a man's heart now and then. You'd better
ship me to the hospital at Saint Louis. They can
patch me up in a week probably. Only, the sooner
you can get me there, the better."</p>

<p>"You call the foreman and tell him to get up
steam on the big launch, Hallowell." Burford,
very pale, took command of the situation. "Miss
Hallowell, will you go and bring Sally Lou? I
want her right away. She's all kinds of good in an
emergency."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>Marian fled, her own heart pounding in her
throat. But Sally Lou, after the first scared questions,
rose to the occasion, steady and serene.</p>

<p>"Light the stove and make our soapstones and
sand-bags piping-hot, Mammy. Heat some bouillon
and put it into the thermos bottle. Ned, you
and the foreman must take him down to Grafton
Landing on the launch. The <i>Lucy Lee</i> is due to
reach Grafton late this afternoon. I'll catch the
<i>Lucy's</i> captain on the long-distance telephone at
the landing above Grafton, and tell him to wait
at Grafton Landing till you get there with Mr.
Carlisle. Then you can put him aboard the <i>Lucy</i>.
She will make Saint Louis in half the time that
you could make it with the launch. Besides, the
<i>Lucy</i> will mean far easier travelling for Mr. Carlisle."</p>

<p>"I never thought of the <i>Lucy</i>! I'd meant to
wait with him at the Landing and take the midnight
train. But the steam-boat will be a far
easier trip. Sally Lou, you certainly are a peach!"
Young Burford looked at his wife with solemn admiration.
"Go and telephone, quick. We'll have
Carlisle ready to start in an hour."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>In less than an hour the launch was made ready,
with cot and pillows and curtains, as like an ambulance
as a launch could well be. With clumsy
anxious pains Roderick and Burford lifted their
chief aboard. Marian hung behind, eager to help,
yet too frightened and nervous to be of service.
But Sally Lou, her yellow hair flying under her
ruffly red bonnet, her baby laughing and crowing
on her shoulder, popped her flushed face gayly
under the awning to bid Mr. Carlisle good-by.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for these babies I'd go straight
along and take care of you myself, Mr. Carlisle,"
she cried. "But the hospital will take better care
of you than I could, I reckon. And the week's vacation
will do you no end of good. Besides it will
set these two lazybones to work." She gave her
husband a gentle shake. "Ned and Mr. Hallowell
will have to depend on themselves, instead of leaving
all the responsibility to you. It will be the
making of them. You'll see!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is true." Carlisle's gray lips
smiled. He was white with suffering, but he
spoke with his unvarying kind formality. "I am
leaving you gentlemen with a pretty heavy load.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
But&mdash;I am not apprehensive. I know that you
boys will stand up to the contract, and that
you will carry it on with success. Good-by, and
good luck to you!"</p>

<p>The launch shot away down-stream. Sally
Lou looked after it. Marian saw her sparkling
eyes grow very grave.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carlisle is mighty brave, isn't he? But
he will not come back to work in a week's time.
No, nor in a month's time either if I know anything
about it. But there's no use a-glooming,
is there, Thomas Tucker! You two come up to
my house and we'll have supper together and
watch for Ned; for if he meets the <i>Lucy</i> at
Grafton he can bring the launch back by ten
to-night."</p>

<p>Sally Lou was a good prophet. It was barely
nine when Ned's launch whistled at the landing.
Ned climbed the steps, looking tired and
excited.</p>

<p>"Yes, we overhauled the <i>Lucy</i>, all right. Mr.
Carlisle seemed much more comfortable when we
put him aboard. He joked me about being so
frightened and said he'd come back in a day or so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
as good as new. But&mdash;I don't know how we'll
manage here. With Carlisle laid up, and Marvin
gone off in the sulks, for nobody knows how long&mdash;Well,
for the next few days this contract is up to
us, Hallowell. That is all there is to that. And
we've got to make good. We've got to put it
through."</p>

<p>"You certainly must make good. And it is
up to us girls to help things along," said Sally Lou,
briskly. "Isn't it, Marian? Yes, I'm going to
call you Marian right away. It's such a saving
of time compared to 'Miss Hallowell.' And the
very first thing to-morrow morning we will drive
over to Mrs. Chrisenberry's, and coax her into
letting you boys start that lateral through her
land."</p>

<p>Three startled faces turned to her. Three
astounded voices rose.</p>

<p>"Coax her, indeed! On my word! When she
drove Rod and me off the place this very morning!"</p>

<p>"Think you dare ask her to take down her barb-wire
barricade and lay away her shot-gun? 'Not
till doomsday!'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>"Sally Lou, are you daft? You've never laid
eyes on Mrs. Chrisenberry. You don't know
what you're tackling. We'll not put that lateral
through till we've dragged the whole question
through the courts. Don't waste your time in
dreaming, child."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to dream. I'm going to act.
You'll go with me, won't you, Marian? We'll
take the babies and the buckboard. But, if you
don't mind, we'll leave Mr. Finnegan at home.
Finnegan's diplomacy is all right, only that it's a
trifle demonstrative. Yes, you boys are welcome
to shake your heads and look owlish. But wait
and see!"</p>

<p>"She'll never try to face that ferocious old
lady," said Rod, on the way home.</p>

<p>"Of course not. She's just making believe,"
rejoined Marian.</p>

<p>Little did they know Sally Lou! Marian had
just finished her breakfast the next morning when
the yellow buckboard, drawn by a solemn, scraggy
horse, drove up to Mrs. Gates's door. On the
front seat, rosy as her scarlet gown and cloak, sat
Sally Lou. From the back seat beamed Mammy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Easter, in her gayest bandanna, with Edward Burford,
Junior, dimpled and irresistible, beside her,
and Thomas Tucker bouncing and crowing in her
arms.</p>

<p>"Climb right in, Miss Northerner! Good-by,
poor Finnegan! This time we're going to try the
persuasive powers of two babies as compared to
those of one collie. Here we go!"</p>

<p>"Are we really going to Mrs. Chrisenberry's?
Are you actually planning to ask her for the right
of way?" queried Marian.</p>

<p>Sally Lou chuckled. Her round face was guileless
and bland.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I am going to Mrs. Chrisenberry's
to buy some goose-grease."</p>

<p>"To buy some <i>goose-grease</i>! Horrors! What is
goose-grease, pray?"</p>

<p>"Goose-grease is goose-grease. Didn't you ever
have the croup when you were young, Miss Northerner?
And didn't they roll you in warm blankets,
and then bandage your poor little throat with
goose-grease and camphor and red pepper?"</p>

<p>"An' a baked onion for your supper," added
Mammy Easter. "An' a big saucer of butterscotch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
sizzlin'-hot. Dey ain't no croup what kin
stand before dat!"</p>

<p>"Mercy, I should hope not. I never heard of
anything so dreadful. You aren't going to give
goose-grease to your own babies, I hope?"</p>

<p>Sally Lou surveyed her uproarious sons, and
allowed herself a brief giggle.</p>

<p>"They've never had a sign of croup so far, I'm
thankful to say. But one ought to be prepared.
And Mrs. Chrisenberry has the finest poultry-yard
in the country-side. We'll enjoy seeing
that, too. Don't look so dubersome. Wait and
see!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Chrisenberry was working in her vegetable
garden as they drove up. Her queer little face
was bound in a huge many-colored "nuby," her
short skirts were kilted over high rubber boots.
She leaned on her spade and gave the girls a
nod that, as Marian told Rod later, was like a
twelve-pound shot squarely across the enemy's
bows.</p>

<p>Sally Lou merely beamed upon her.</p>

<p>"Wet weather for putting in your garden, isn't
it?" she cried, gayly. "I'm Mrs. Burford, Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Chrisenberry. My husband is an engineer on
the Breckenridge contract."</p>

<p>"H'm!" Mrs. Chrisenberry glared. Sally Lou
chattered gayly on.</p>

<p>"I'm staying down at the canal with these two
youngsters, and I want to buy some of your fine
goose-grease. They've never had croup in all
their born days, but it's such a cold, wet spring
that it is well to be prepared for anything."</p>

<p>"Goose-grease!" Mrs. Chrisenberry looked at
her keenly. "For those babies? Highty-tighty!
Goose-grease is well enough, but hot mutton taller
is better yet. I've raised two just as fine boys
as them, so I know. Mutton taller an' camphire,
that's sovereign."</p>

<p>She put down her spade and picked her way to
the buckboard. Edward Junior hailed her with
a shriek of welcome. Thomas Tucker floundered
wildly in Mammy's grasp and clutched Mrs.
Chrisenberry around the neck with a strangling
squeeze.</p>

<p>Marian gasped. For Mrs. Chrisenberry, grim,
stern little nut-cracker lady, had lifted Thomas
to her stooped little shoulder and was gathering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Edward Junior into a lean strong little arm.
Both babies crowed with satisfaction. Thomas
jerked off the tasselled nuby and showered rose-leaf
kisses from Mrs. Chrisenberry's tight knob of
gray hair to the tip of her dour little chin. Edward
pounded her gleefully with fists and feet.</p>

<p>"They'll strangle her," Marian whispered,
aghast.</p>

<p>"Pooh, she doesn't mind," Sally Lou whispered
back. "You mustn't let them pull you to pieces,
Mrs. Chrisenberry. They're as strong as little
bear cubs."</p>

<p>"Guess I know that." Mrs. Chrisenberry
shook Edward's fat grip loose from her tatting
collar. "They're the living images of my own
boys, thirty years ago. I hope your children
bring you as good luck as mine have brought me.
They've grown up as fine men as you'd find in a
day's journey. Let me take 'em to see the hen
yard. They'll like to play with the little chickens,
I know."</p>

<p>Edward and Thomas Tucker were charmed with
the hen yard. They fell upon a brood of tiny yellow
balls with cries of ecstasy. Only the irate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
pecks and squawks of the outraged hen mother
prevented them from hugging the fuzzy peepers to
a loving death.</p>

<p>"They're a pretty lively team," remarked Mrs.
Chrisenberry. "Let's take 'em into the house,
and I'll give them some cookies and milk. I don't
know much about new-fangled ways of feeding
children, but I do know that my cookies never
hurt anybody yet."</p>

<p>She led them through her shining kitchen into
a big, bright sitting-room. Again Marian halted
to stare. This was not the customary chill and
dreary farm-house "parlor." Instead, she saw
a wide, fire-lit living-room, filled with flowering
plants, home-like with its books and pictures;
and at the arched bay-window a beautiful upright
piano.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chrisenberry followed her glance.</p>

<p>"Land, I don't ever touch it," she said, with a
dry little nut-cracker chuckle. "My oldest boy
he gave it to me, for he knows I'm that hungry
for music, and whenever my daughter-in-law comes
to visit she plays for me by the hour, and it's
something grand. And now and then a neighbor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
will pick out a tune for me. My, don't I wish I
could keep it goin' all the time! You girls don't
play, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Sally Lou's eyes met Marian's with a quick
question. Marian's cheeks grew hot.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I play a little. But I'm sure that Mrs.
Burford&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Burford will play some other time,"
interrupted Sally Lou, hastily. "Go on, that's a
good girl!"</p>

<p>Now, it bored Marian dismally to play for strangers.
She refused so habitually that few of her
friends knew what a delightful pianist she really
was. But dimly she realized that Sally Lou's
eyes were flashing with anxious command. She
opened the piano.</p>

<p>She ran through the airs from the "Tales from
Hoffmann," then played a romping folk-dance,
and, at last, the lovely magic of the "Spring Song."</p>

<p>Mrs. Chrisenberry hardly breathed. She sat
rigidly in her chair, her knotted little hands shut
tight, her beady eyes unwinking.</p>

<p>"My, but that goes to the place," she sighed,
as the last airy harmony died away. "Now I'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
bring your cookies and milk, you lambs, and then
you'd better be starting home. It looks like
rain."</p>

<p>Marian and Sally Lou fell behind in the procession
to the carriage. Edward Junior toddled
down the board walk, clinging to his hostess's
skirt. Thomas Tucker laughed and gurgled in
her arms. Mrs. Chrisenberry put Thomas on
Mammy's lap, then picked up Edward, who,
loath to depart, squeezed her neck with warm,
crumby little hands and snuggled his fat cheek
to her own. Mrs. Chrisenberry looked down at
him. Her grim little nut-cracker face quivered
oddly. A dim pink warmed her brown, withered
cheek.</p>

<p>"It's nice while they're little, isn't it?" she said,
with a queer, wistful smile. "Though I dassent
complain. My boys are the best sons anybody
ever had, and they treat me like a queen. Here,
son, stop pulling my ears so hard; it hurts. Now,
I'll send you a whole bowlful of mutton taller to-morrow;
and a jar of goose-grease the very next
rendering I make. Didn't you say you're living
on the drainage job? Well"&mdash;the dim pink grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
bright in her cheek&mdash;"well, you tell your man that
he kin go right ahead and cut his ditch through my
land. I'll not stand in the way no longer. Though
tell him that I'll expect him to see that his men
don't tramp through my garden nor steal my
watermelons. Mind that."</p>

<p>"I know I can promise that, always." Sally
Lou's eyes were brown stars. "And thank you
more than tongue can tell, Mrs. Chrisenberry.
You don't know what this will mean to my husband,
and I never can tell you how much we shall
appreciate your kindness. Packed in all right,
Mammy? Come, Edward, son. Good-by!"</p>

<p>They drove away in the silence of utter, astonished
joy.</p>

<p>"Your goose-grease worked that miracle, Sally
Lou!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! It was your music that carried the
day. But oh, I was so afraid you were going to
say no!"</p>

<p>Again Marian's cheeks flushed hot, with queer,
vexed shame.</p>

<p>"Well, I did all but refuse. I do hate to play for
anybody, especially for strangers."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" Sally Lou looked hopelessly puzzled.
"But when it gives them so much pleasure! And
besides, if you want a selfish reason, think how you
have helped the boys. There they come now."</p>

<p>With a joyful call Sally Lou waved her scarf to
the two figures plodding up the canal road. Then
as the flimsy silk could not do justice to her feelings,
she caught up little Thomas Tucker and flourished
him, a somewhat ponderous banner. The
boys hurried to meet them. They listened to the
girls' excited tale, at first unbelieving, then with
faces of amazement and relief.</p>

<p>"Well, you two girls deserve a diamond medal,"
declared Burford, heartily. His flushed, perturbed
face brightened. "You don't know what a load
you have taken off our shoulders." He looked at
Roderick. "This is a real sterling-silver lining to
our cloud, isn't it, Hallowell? So big that it fairly
bulges out around the edges."</p>

<p>"A silver lining to what cloud, Ned?" demanded
Sally Lou, promptly curious. "Has something
gone wrong with the work? Another break in the
machinery? Or trouble among the laborers, or
what?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>The two boys looked at each other. Marian
studied their faces. Burford was flushed and excited.
Rod's stolid, dark face was frowning and
intent.</p>

<p>"Own up!" commanded Sally Lou, sternly.
"Don't you dare try to keep your dark and dreadful
secrets from us!"</p>

<p>The boys laughed. But a quick warning glance
flashed from one to the other. Then Burford
spoke.</p>

<p>"Don't conjure up so many bogies, Sally Lou.
We&mdash;we've had bad news from Mr. Carlisle. His
doctor told me, over the long-distance, that he
would not be able to leave the hospital for a fortnight.
And he must not come back on the work
for two months at the best."</p>

<p>Sally Lou sobered.</p>

<p>"That is bad news. Poor Mr. Carlisle! But is
that all that you have to tell me, Ned?"</p>

<p>Burford jumped. He reddened a little.</p>

<p>"Y-yes, I reckon that's all. You girls will have
to excuse us now. Hallowell and I are going back
to our boat-house to fix up our March reports."</p>

<p>"Anything we two can help about?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>"You two have put in a mighty good day's work
in securing that right of way. Though if you're
hunting for a job you might verify the yardage
report I left on your desk. Run along now, we're
going to be busy."</p>

<p>"Such is gratitude," remarked Sally Lou, with
ironic philosophy, as she drove away. "'Run
along, we're busy.' Just like a boy!"</p>

<p>Roderick and Ned looked after the buckboard, a
little shame-faced at Sally Lou's parting shot.</p>

<p>"Just the same, it does no good to tell them all
our ill-luck," said Burford.</p>

<p>"And Marvin's threatening to quit is even worse
luck than Carlisle's illness. For his quarrel with
the foreman has started half a dozen quarrels
among the workmen. Queer, isn't it? A grouch
like that will spread like wild-fire through a whole
camp."</p>

<p>"Marvin is waiting on the house-boat for us
this minute." Ned peered through a telescope
of his hands. "Now we'll listen to a tale of woe!"</p>

<p>Marvin did not wait till they could reach the
boat. His angry voice rang out across the canal.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>Mister</i> Hallowell! I just got the note
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
that you so kindly sent me. So you and Mr. Burford
here think that I ought to stand by the job,
hey, 'and not let my private quarrels influence
me into deserting the contract?' Thank you,
<i>Mister</i> Hallowell, for your kind advice. But I
rather guess I can get along without any orders
from either of you two swells. No, nor criticisms,
either."</p>

<p>"We're not giving orders, and you know that,
Marvin." Rod spoke sharply. "But you're never
going to throw down your billet just because
of a two-cent fuss with the foreman. Think what
a hole you'd leave the company in! Carlisle
sick, high water holding back our freight, coal shipments
stalled, everything tied up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you're directly responsible to the company
for that berm construction," broke in Burford
hotly. "You know well enough that we can't
watch that work and oversee the ditch-cutting at
one and the same time. You're not going to sneak
out and play quitter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to play quitter, as you call it, whenever
I choose. That happens to be right now.
You two silk-stockings can like it, or lump it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Mulcahy!" he yelled to the camp commissary
man, who was just starting down the canal in his
launch on his way to Grafton for supplies. "Wait,
I'm going with you. Here, take this."</p>

<p>He bolted into his cabin, then dashed back,
carrying a heavy suit-case. He heaved it into the
launch, then sprang in beside the open-mouthed
steward.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm off!" He blazed the words at the
two boys staring from the bank. "You can run
this contract to suit yourselves, gentlemen. I'll
send my resignation direct to the company. I
don't have to take orders from you two swells another
hour. Good-morning, gentlemen!"</p>

<p>The steward grinned sheepishly at sight of his
superior officer behaving himself like a spunky
small boy. With a rueful nod toward Roderick
he headed the launch down the canal.</p>

<p>Burford expressed himself with some vim.</p>

<p>"Well, he's gone. Good riddance, I call it. The
surly hound!"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," muttered Rod.
"It was my fault, maybe, writing him that letter.
I was too high and mighty, I suppose."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>"You needn't blame yourself," returned Burford
bluntly. "We've put up with his insolence
and his scamped work and his everlasting wrangling
long enough. Mr. Carlisle won't blame us;
neither will the company."</p>

<p>"We ought to wire company head-quarters at
Chicago, and report just how things stand; then
they'll send us a supervising engineer to take Mr.
Carlisle's place. And a new scrub, too, instead
of Marvin."</p>

<p>"You're right, Hallowell. You wire them
straight off, will you? I'm going up to the first
lateral to watch the afternoon shift."</p>

<p>Early that evening Roderick received the answering
wire from head-quarters. He read it carefully.
His sober young face settled into grim lines.</p>

<p>An hour later Burford turned up, tired, but in
high spirits, for his dredge had made a flying
start on the lateral. Roderick handed him the
despatch.</p>

<p>The two boys stared at each other. A deep
flush burned to Burford's temples. Rod's hard
jaw set.</p>

<p>The message was curt and to the point.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>c/o Contract Camp, Grafton, Illinois.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir:</i> Your report received. Consider yourself

</div>

<p>"So we're made jointly responsible. Put in
charge by Breckenridge. By Breck the Great, his
very self. H'm-m." Burford looked out at the
crowded boats, the muddy, half-built levee,
stretching far as eye could see; the night shift
of laborers, eighty strong, shuffling aboard the
quarter-boat for their hot supper; the massed,
powerful machinery, stretching its black funnels
and cranes against the red evening sky. "So
we're the two Grand Panjandrums on this job.
Responsible for excavation that means prosperity
or ruin for half the farmers in the district, according
as we do or don't finish those laterals
before the June rise; responsible for a pay-roll
that runs over four hundred dollars a day; responsible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
for a time-lock contract that will cost
our company five hundred dollars forfeit money a
day for every day that we run over our time limit.
Well, Hallowell?"</p>

<p>"It strikes me," said Rod, very briefly, "that
it's up to us."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is up to us. But if we don't make
good&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't let that worry you." Rod's jaw set,
steel. "Don't give that a thought. We'll make
good."
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
THE CONTRACT'S RECEIVING DAY</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, Sis!" It was Roderick's voice over
the telephone. "How are you feeling this fine,
muggy morning?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well, I suppose. How are you, Rod?
Where are you telephoning from?"</p>

<p>"From Burford's shack. We're in a pinch down
here, Marian. We need you to help out. Can't
you ask Mr. Gates to hitch up and bring you down
to camp right away? Or if you'll walk down to
Gates's Landing I'll send Mulcahy with the
launch, to bring you the rest of the way. And put
on your very best toggery, Sis. War paint and
feathers and all that. That pretty lavender silk
rig will do. But don't forget the gimcracks.
Put on all the jewelry you own."</p>

<p>"Why, Roderick Hallowell! What can you
mean? Dress up in my best, and come down to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
camp at nine in the morning, and on Sunday morning
at that?"</p>

<p>"I mean just what I say." Then Roderick
chuckled irresistibly. "Poor Sis, I don't wonder
you're puzzled. But Sunday is the contract's day
at home, and we want you to stand in line and
receive; or pour tea, whichever you prefer to do.
Do you see?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't see. All I do see is that you're
talking nonsense. And I don't intend to come
down to the camp. It is such a hot, horrid morning,
I don't propose to stir. I want you to come
up and spend the day here instead. Mrs. Gates
wants you, too, she says, for dinner and for supper
as well. And yesterday the rural-delivery man
brought a whole armful of new magazines. We'll
sit on the porch, and you can read and I'll write
letters, and we'll have a lovely, quiet day together."</p>

<p>There was a pause. When Roderick spoke
again, his voice was rather quenched.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Sis, but it isn't possible for me to come,
even for dinner. I'll be hard at it here, every
minute of the day."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean that you must work on the contract
all day Sunday? When you have worked
fourteen hours a day, ever since you came West?"
Marian's voice was very tart. "Can't you stop
long enough to go to church with me, even?
There's a beautiful little church four miles away.
It's just a pleasant drive. Surely you can give up
two hours of the morning, if you can spare no more
time!"</p>

<p>"It isn't a question of what I'm willing to do.
And I am not planning to work on Sunday. As
you know, Sis, we bank our fires Saturday night
and give the laborers a day off. Nearly all the
men left for town last night to stay till Monday.
But listen. Burford tells me that, on every clear
Sunday, we can expect a visit from most of the
land-owners for miles around. And not just from
the land-owners themselves: their sisters, and
their cousins, and their aunts; and the children,
and the neighbors, and the family cat. They want
to see for themselves just how the work is going
on. When you stop to think, it's their own work.
Their money is paying for every shovelful of dirt
we move, and every inch of levee-work. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
they're paying every copper of our salaries, too.
They have a right to see how their own investment
is being used, Sis."</p>

<p>"So you have to treat these country people as
honored guests! Cart them up and down the
canal, and show them the excavations, and let
them pry into your reports, and ask you silly
questions! Of all the tiresome, preposterous
things!"</p>

<p>"That's pretty much what we'll do. But there
is nothing preposterous about it; it's their right.
And we fellows want to do the decent thing. Now,
more than ever, we want to do everything properly
because Carlisle is sick and away. Burford says
that Carlisle was more exacting about these visits
of inspection than about anything else on the plant.
He said that when a man builds a house to protect
his family he has the right to oversee every inch
of the construction, if he likes. On the same principle,
these farmers who are digging canals and
putting up levees to protect their lands should
have the right to watch the work, step by step.
Burford says, too, that Carlisle, with his everlasting
patience and courtesy, was steadily winning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
over the whole district; even the men who had
fought the first assessments tooth and nail. It is
the least we boys can do to keep up the good
feeling that Carlisle has established."</p>

<p>"Well, I think it is all very absurd. Why
should I come down to the work? These people
do not even know that I exist. And if you really
need somebody to talk to their wives and be gracious
and all that, why can't Mrs. Burford do it
better than I? She is right on the ground, anyway."</p>

<p>"Yes, she's right on the ground. And so is
Thomas Tucker's newest tooth. The poor little
skeezicks howled half the night, Burford says.
He has stopped yelling just now, but he won't let
his mother out of his sight for one minute. Mrs.
Burford is pretty much worn to a frazzle. But I
don't want to pester you, Marian." There was a
worried note in Rod's voice now. "I wouldn't
have you come for any consideration, if it were to
make you ill or tired. So perhaps we'd better not
think of it."</p>

<p>Marian shrugged her shoulders. An odd, teasing
question stirred in her mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>"I rather think I can stand the day if you can.
Finnegan and I will be at the landing in half an
hour. I, and my best beads and wampum, and
my new spring hat. There, now!"</p>

<p>Not waiting for Rod's delighted reply, she hurried
away to dress. A whimsical impulse led her
to put on her freshest and daintiest gown, a charming
lilac silk, with a wide, tilting picture hat,
heaped with white and purple lilacs. She was
standing at the little pier, tugging at her long
gloves, when the duty-launch, with Rod himself
at the wheel, shot round the bend. Rod waved
his hand; then, at sight of her amazing finery, he
burst into a whoop of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Will you look at that! Marian Hallowell,
you're the best ever. I might have known you'd
play up. Though I was scared stiff, for fear you'd
think that just every-day clothes would do. My,
but you're stunning! You're looking stronger,
too, Sis. You're not nearly so wan and spooky as
you were a week ago."</p>

<p>"I'm feeling better, too." Marian's color rose.
Even her sulky humor must melt under Rod's
beaming approval. "Now give me my sailing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
orders, Rod. How many callers will we have?
What sort of people will they be? Tart and grim,
like Mrs. Chrisenberry, I suppose, or else kindly
and bashful and 'woodsy,' like the Gateses? Will
they stop by on their way home from church, or
will they come promptly after dinner and spend
the afternoon?"</p>

<p>Rod laughed. "No telling, Sister. We may
have ten callers, we may have a hundred. You'll
find all kinds of people among them; precisely as
you'll find all kinds of people on Mount Vernon
Street, Boston, Massachusetts. There'll be nice,
neighborly folks who'll drive up the canal road in
Bond Street motoring clothes and sixty-horse-power
cars. There'll be other nice, neighborly
folks who'll ride in through the woods on their
plough horses, wearing slat sunbonnets and hickory
shirts. And they'll be friendly, and critical,
and enthusiastic, and dubersome, all in a heap.
You'll need all your social experience, and all your
tact, and all the diplomacy you can muster.
See?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm beginning to see." Marian's eyes
were thoughtful. Then she sprang up to wave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
her lilac parasol in greeting to the martin-box and
Sally Lou.</p>

<p>"Isn't this the most mournful luck that ever
was!" Sally Lou sat with Thomas Tucker, a forlorn
little figure, planted firmly on her knee. "To
think that my son must spend his first afternoon
of the season in cutting a wicked double tooth!
Maybe it'll come through by dinner-time, though.
Then he'll go to sleep, and I can slip over and help
you entertain our people&mdash;Why, Marian Hallowell!
Oh, what a lovely, lovely gown! You wise
child, how did you know that to wear it to-day
was precisely the wisest thing that you could possibly
do!"</p>

<p>"I didn't know that. I just put it on. Partly
for fun, and&mdash;well, partly to provoke Rod, I suppose."
Marian felt rather foolish. But she had
no time for further confidences.</p>

<p>Up the muddy canal road came a roomy family
carriage, drawn by a superbly matched black
team. That carriage was packed solid to the
dashboard. Father, two tall boys, and a rosy
little daughter crammed the front seat; mother,
grandmother, and aunty were fitted neatly into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the back; and a fringe of small fry swung from
every direction.</p>

<p>"Morning." The father reined in and gave
everybody a friendly nod and smile. "How are
you, Mr. Burford? Glad to meet you, Mr. Hallowell.
No, thank you, we're on our way to Sunday-school
and church, so we haven't a minute to
stop. But I have been wanting to know how you
think lateral four will work out; the one that
turns down past my farm. Will that sand cut
give you much trouble?"</p>

<p>"It will make slower dredging, Mr. Moore.
But we'll put it through as fast as we can."</p>

<p>"Um. I'm in no hurry to see it go through.
The high water isn't due for a month, anyway.
Now, I don't know much about sand-cutting. But
I've been told that your worst trouble in a sand
streak is with the slides. After your dredge-dipper
has dumped the stuff ashore, it won't stay
put. It keeps tobogganing back into the channel
and blocking your cut. So sometimes you have to
hoist it out two or three times over."</p>

<p>"That's exactly the case, Mr. Moore. Usually
our levee gangs follow along and tamp the sand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
down, or else spread it back from the berm where
it has no chance to slide. But it is getting so near
the time set for the completion of our upper lateral
cut that we are obliged to keep our levee shift at
work on the upper laterals and take our chances
on the sand staying where we pile it."</p>

<p>"Just what I'd supposed. Now, I shall need
a lot of that sand, in a week or so, for some cement
work. S'pose I send you a couple of teams and
half a dozen hands to-morrow, to cart off the sand
under your direction. Would that help things
along?"</p>

<p>"Help things along? I should say it would!"
Rod beamed. "It would be the most timely help
we could ask."</p>

<p>"But won't it put you to a lot of trouble, sir,"
asked Burford, "to take the hands off their regular
farm-work in that way?"</p>

<p>"W-well, no. Anyway they can haul sand for
a day or so without making much difference.
And it will be a heap handier for you boys to have
the stuff carted off as fast as you throw it ashore."</p>

<p>"It surely will. That's the best news we've
heard in one while!" The boys stood smiling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
at each other, completely radiant. Mr. Moore
nodded and turned his horses.</p>

<p>"Glad if it will be any accommodation. Well,
good day to you all. My good wishes to Mr. Carlisle.
Tell him I said he left a couple of mighty
competent substitutes, but that his neighbors will
be glad to see him coming back, just the same."</p>

<p>The big carriage with its gay load rolled away.</p>

<p>"So Moore will send men and teams to help us
on that sand cut!" Burford, fairly chortling with
satisfaction, started toward the martin-box. "If
all our land-owners treated us with half the consideration
that he always gives, our work would be
a summer's dream. I'm going up to tell Sally
Lou."</p>

<p>He had hardly reached the martin-box before
he turned with a shout.</p>

<p>"There come our next visitors, Hallowell. The
commodore and Mrs. McCloskey, in that fat little
white launch. See?"</p>

<p>Commodore McCloskey it was, indeed. Finnegan's
wild yelp of delighted greeting would have
told as much. Marian promptly joined the hilarious
race to the pier. The commodore, crisp and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
blinding-white in his starchy duck, stood at his
launch wheel, majestic as if he stood on the bridge
of an ocean liner. But Mrs. McCloskey, a dainty,
soft-eyed, little old lady, with cheeks like Scotch
roses, and silky curls white as dandelion down
blowing from under her decorous gray bonnet,
won Marian's heart at the first glance. She was
as quaint and gentle and charming as an old-time
miniature.</p>

<p>While the boys took the commodore up and
down the laterals that he might see their progress
since his last visit, Mrs. McCloskey trailed her
soft old black silk skirts to the martin-box door
and begged for a glimpse of the baby.</p>

<p>"He's crosser than a prickly little porcupine,"
protested Sally Lou, handing him over reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, but he'll come to me just the minute!
Won't you, lamb?"</p>

<p>And like a lamb Thomas Tucker forgot his sorrows
and snuggled happily into her tender arms,
while his relieved mother bustled about and helped
Marian to make a generous supply of lemonade;
for half a dozen carriage loads of visitors were now
coming up the road.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis amazin'. Where do they all come from?"
observed Mrs. McCloskey. "Yet there's nigh
three hundred land-owners in this district. And
the commodore, he passed the word yesterday that
there's close on two hundred thousand acres of
land that will be protected by this one drainage
contract. Think of that, Miss Marian. Is it not
grand to know that your brother is giving the
power of his hands and his brains to such a big,
helping work as all that?"</p>

<p>"Why, I suppose so." Marian spoke absently.</p>

<p>"And ye will be a help to him, too, I can see
that." Mrs. McCloskey put out a hesitating
little hand in a quaint old silken mitt and patted
Marian's fluffy gown. "'Tis not everybody makes
as bould as meself to tell you in so many words of
your pretty finery. But sure 'tis everybody that
will appreciate it, an' be pleased an' honored
with the compliment of it."</p>

<p>Marian looked utterly puzzled.</p>

<p>"You think that I can be a help to Rod? Why,
I don't know the least thing about his work. I
really don't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you a magic-maker, Auntie McCloskey!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Sally Lou put down the lemon-squeezer
and stared. "Look at that precious baby! Sound
asleep in your lap! While I haven't been able to
pacify him for one minute, though I walked and
sang all night!"</p>

<p>"'Tis the cruel tooth has come through, I'm
thinkin'." Mrs. McCloskey laid the peaceful little
porcupine tenderly into his crib. "Now,
I'll stay and watch him while you two go and
meet your guests. I'll call you the minute he
chirps."</p>

<p>The two girls hurried to greet their callers, to
offer them chairs on the shady side of the quarter-boat,
to serve them with iced tea and lemonade.
Much to Marian's surprise, she found herself
chattering away vigorously and actually enjoying
it all. As Rod had said, the slow stream that came
and went all day included all sorts and conditions
of folk. There were the gracious old clergyman and
his sweet, motherly wife, who stopped for a pleasant
half-hour, then jogged on across the country
to his "afternoon meeting," twelve miles out in
the lowlands. There were the two brisk young
plutocrats from the great Kensington stock farm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
up-river, who flashed up in a stunning satiny-gray
French car, for a brief exchange of courtesies.
There were two of the district commissioners,
quiet, keen-eyed gentlemen. One of these men,
Rod told his sister later, was doing valuable service
to the community by his experiments in improving
the yield of corn throughout the district.
The other commissioner was a lawyer of national
reputation. Mrs. Chrisenberry stopped by, too:
a brusque little visitor, sitting very stiff and fine
in her cushioned phaeton, her beady eyes darting
questions through her shrewd spectacles. Marian,
feeling very real gratitude, devoted herself to Mrs.
Chrisenberry. That lady, however, hardly spoke
till just as she was starting to go. Then she leaned
forward in her carriage. She fixed Marian with
a gimlet eye.</p>

<p>"It's agreeable to see that you think we district
folks <i>is</i> folks," she said, very tartly indeed. "I'd
some mistrusted the other day, but I guess now
that you know what's what. Good-afternoon,
all."</p>

<p>"Well, Sally Lou! Will you tell me what she
meant?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>Sally Lou nodded wisely.</p>

<p>"Your pretty dress, I suspect. Didn't you hear
Mrs. McCloskey praise it, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" And now Marian's face was very
thoughtful indeed.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon came the one disagreeable
episode of the day.</p>

<p>The drainage district, upon which Roderick
and Burford were employed, had become part of
a huge league known as the Central Mississippi
Drainage Association. This league had recently
been organized. Its object was the cutting of
protective ditches on a gigantic scale, and its
annual expenditures for this work would run
well past the million mark. Naturally there was
strong competition between all the great engineering
firms to win a favorable standing in the eyes
of this new and powerful corporation. The Breckenridge
Company, because of its superior record,
was easily in the lead. None the less, as Rod had
remarked a day or so before, it was up to every
member of the Breckenridge Company, from Breck
the Great down to the meekest cub engineer, to
keep that lead.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>Burford jeered mildly at Rod for taking his own
small importance to the company so seriously.</p>

<p>"Just you wait and see," retorted Roderick.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll wait, all right," laughed Burford.
To-day, however, he was destined to see; and
to see almost too clearly for his own peace of
mind.</p>

<p>A sumptuous limousine car whirled up the
muddy road. Its lordly door swung open; down
stepped a large, autocratic gentleman, in raiment
of startling splendor, followed by a quiet, courteous
elderly man.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Ellingworth Locke, of New York.
I am the acting president of the Central Mississippi
Drainage Association," announced the magnificent
one. "You gentlemen, I take it, are the&mdash;ah&mdash;the
junior engineers left in charge by Mr.
Carlisle?"</p>

<p>Roderick and Burford admitted their identity.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Crosby, our consulting engineer.
Now that this district has joined the association,
it comes under our direct surveillance. Mr.
Crosby and I desire to go over your laterals and
get an idea of your work thus far."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>"We are honored." Burford bowed low and
welcomed his guests with somewhat flamboyant
courtesy. He led the way to the duty-launch.
Roderick followed, bringing the cushions and the
tarpaulin which the quick-witted Sally Lou hastily
commanded him to carry aboard for the potentate's
comfort.</p>

<p>Of all their guests, that long day, the acting
president was the sole critic. At every rod of the
big ditch, at every turn of the laterals, he found
some petty fault. The consulting engineer, Mr.
Crosby, followed him about in embarrassed silence.
He was obviously annoyed by his employer's
rudeness. However, for all Mr. Locke's
strictures, it was evident that he could find no
serious fault with the work. Yet both boys were
tingling with vexation and chagrin when the regal
limousine rolled away at last.</p>

<p>"What does ail his highness? Did ever you see
such a beautiful grouch?" Rod mopped his forehead
and stared belligerently after the car.</p>

<p>"Nothing ails him but a badly swelled head."
Burford's jaw set hard. "The fact of it is, that
the worshipful Mr. Ellingworth Locke hasn't two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
pins' worth of practical knowledge of dredging.
He is a New York banker, and he has no understanding
of conditions west of the Hudson. His
bank is to make the loans for the association's
drainage, and he has bought a big tract of land in
this district. That is why he was elected acting
president. Do you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that helps to explain things."</p>

<p>"So he struts around and tries to pick flaws
with the most trifling points of our construction, to
keep us from guessing how little he really knows
about the big underlying principles. Gentle innocent,
he tries to think he's an expert!" Burford
waved a disrespectful muddy paw after the
flying car. "All that an acting president is good
for, anyway, is to wear white spats and to put on
side."</p>

<p>"Well, that engineer knows his job."</p>

<p>"Crosby? Yes, he's an engineer all right. And
a gentleman, too. Just the same, I'm glad we
kowtowed to Mr. Locke. His opinion is so influential
that his approval may mean a tremendous
advantage to the Breckenridge Company some
day."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm hoping that Breckenridge himself will
come before long and give us a looking over."</p>

<p>"I'm hoping for that myself. Half an hour of
Breck will swing everything into shape. You
want to know Breckenridge if ever you get the
chance, Hallowell. He's the grandest ever. Just
to watch him tramp up and down a ditch, great
big silent figure that he is, and hear him fire off
those cool, close-mouthed questions of his at you,
brings you bristling up like a fighting-cock. He's
a regular inspiration, I call him."</p>

<p>"I'm banking on the chance that I shall know
him some day." Rod's eyes lighted. He remembered
the words of his old professor, "To
work under Breckenridge is not only an advantage
to any engineer. It is an education in itself."</p>

<p>It was nearly six o'clock when their last callers
arrived. They were not an interesting carriage
load: a gaunt, silent, middle-aged man; a sallow-cheeked
young woman, in cheap, showy clothes,
her rough hands glittering with gaudy rings; and
a six-year-old girl&mdash;a pitiful little ghost of a girl&mdash;who
looked like a frail little shadow against Sally
Lou's lusty, rosy two-year-old son. Her warped,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
tiny body in its forlorn lace-trimmed pink silk
dress was braced in pillows in her mother's arms.
Her dim black eyes stared listlessly with the indifference
of long suffering.</p>

<p>Marian was always shaken and repelled by the
sight of pain. But by this time Thomas Tucker
was awake and loudly demanding his mother; so
Marian must do her shrinking best, to make the
new-comers feel themselves welcomed.</p>

<p>"No, Mamie she don't drink lemonade. No,
she don't want no milk, neither. We'll just
set here in the cool and rest a while till pappy
gets through lookin' around." The young, tired
mother sat down on the little pier. She settled
the wan little creature carefully into her arms
again. "No, there's nothing you can get for her;
nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Doesn't she like to look at pictures? I have
some new magazines," ventured Marian.</p>

<p>"She does like pictures once in a while. Want
to see what the lady's got for you, Mamie?"</p>

<p>Mamie roused herself and looked silently at the
books that Marian piled before her. Bent on
pleasing the little wraith, Marian cut out several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
lovely ladies, and on a sudden inspiration added
rosy cheeks from Rod's tray of colored pencils.</p>

<p>Those red and blue and purple pencils caught
Mamie's listless eye. She even bestirred herself
to try and draw a portrait or so with her own shaky
little fingers.</p>

<p>"Beats all," sighed her mother. A little
pleased color rose in her cheeks. "I haven't seen
her take such an interest for months. Not even
in her dollies. We buy her all the playthings we
can think of. Her pappy, he don't ever go to
town without he up and brings her a whole grist
of candy and toys and clutter. But we never once
thought of the pencils for her. Nor of paper dolls,
either. My, I'm glad we stopped by. And her
pappy, he'll be more pleased than words can tell.
He's always so heart-set for Mamie to have a little
fun."</p>

<p>"She must take these pencils home with her.
Rod has a whole boxful." Marian tied up not
only the pencils, but a generous roll of Rod's heavy
drawing-paper, expressly adapted to making paper
dolls that would stand alone. The child clutched
the bundle in her little lean hands without a word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
of thanks. But her white little face was eloquent.
So was her father's face when he came to carry her
away, and heard her mother's story of the new
pleasure.</p>

<p>"Well, this day has meant hard work all right,
even though it was a day of rest from my regular
work," said Roderick. He was swinging the
launch up the canal to the Gates's Landing. "It's
a queer way to spend Sunday, isn't it, Sis? But it
seems to be the only way for me just at present.
And you can be sure that we're obliged to you, old
lady, for the way that you've held up your end."</p>

<p>"I didn't mind the day, nor did I mind meeting
all those people nearly as much as I'd imagined
that I would," pondered Marian. "Especially
the McCloskeys, the dear things! And that poor
little crippled child, too. I wish I could do something
more for her. Y-yes, as you say, it was
pretty hard work. I'm rather tired to-night. But
the day was well worth while."</p>

<p>But just how worth while that day had been,
neither Rod nor Marian could know.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
THE COAL AND THE COMMODORE</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>"Ready for breakfast, Miss Hallowell?" Mrs.
Gates's pleasant voice summoned her.</p>

<p>"Just a minute." Marian loitered at the window,
looking out at the transformed woods and
fields. She could hardly believe her eyes. Two
weeks ago only stark, leafless branches and muddy
gray earth had stretched before her. But in these
fourteen days, the magic of early April had
wrought wonders. The trees stood clothed in
shining new leaves, thick and luxuriant as a New
England June. The fields were sheets of living
green.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem real," she sighed happily.
"It isn't the same country that it was when I first
came."</p>

<p>"No more are you the same girl." Mrs. Gates
nodded approvingly behind the tall steaming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
coffee-pot. "My, you were that peaky and piney!
But nowadays you're getting some real red in
your cheeks, and you eat more like a human being
and less like a canary-bird."</p>

<p>Marian twinkled.</p>

<p>"Your brother is gettin' to be the peaky one,
nowadays," went on Mrs. Gates, with her placid
frankness. "Seems to me I never saw a boy look
as beat out as he does, ever since that big cave-in
on the canal last week. I'm thankful for this
good weather for him. Maybe he can make up
for the time they lost digging out the cave-in if
it stays clear and the creeks don't rise any higher.
He's a real worker, isn't he? Seems like he'd
slave the flesh off his bones before he'd let his
job fall behind. But I don't like to see him look
so gaunt and tired. It isn't natural in a boy like
him."</p>

<p>Marian looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why, Rod is always strong and well."</p>

<p>"He's strong, yes. But even strong folks can
tire out. Flesh and blood aren't steel and wire.
You'd better watch him pretty sharp, now that hot
weather is coming. He needs it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>Marian pushed back her plate with a frown.
Her dainty breakfast had suddenly lost its savor.</p>

<p>"Watch over Rod! I should think it was Rod's
place to watch over me, instead. And when I have
been so ill, too!" she said to herself.</p>

<p>Yet a queer little thorn of anxiety pricked her.
She called Mr. Finnegan and raced with him
down through the wet green woods to the canal.
Roderick stood on the dredge platform, talking to
the head dredge-runner. He hailed Marian with
a shout.</p>

<p>"You're just in time to see me off, Sis. I'm
going to Saint Louis to hurry up our coal shipment."</p>

<p>"The coal shipment? I thought a barge-load of
coal was due here yesterday."</p>

<p>"Due, yes. But it hasn't turned up, and we're
on our last car-load this minute. That's serious.
We'll have to shut down if I can't hurry a supply
to camp within thirty-six hours."</p>

<p>Marian followed him aboard the engineers'
house-boat and watched him pack his suit-case.</p>

<p>"Why are you taking all those time-books, Rod?
Surely you will not have time to make up your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
week's reports during that three-hour trip on the
train?"</p>

<p>"These aren't my weekly reports. These are
tabulated operating expenses. President Sturdevant,
the head of our company, has just announced
that he wants us to furnish data for
every working day. He's a bit of a martinet, you
know. He wants everything figured up into shape
for immediate reference. He says he proposes to
follow the cost of this job, excavation, fill, everything,
within thirty-six hours of the time when the
actual work is done. He doesn't realize that that
means hours of expert book-keeping, and that we
haven't a book-keeper in the camp. So Burford
and I have had to tackle it, in addition to our
regular work. And it's no trifle." Roderick
rolled up a formidable mass of notes. There was
a worried tone in his steady voice.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't the company send you a book-keeper?"</p>

<p>"Burford and I are planning to ask for one when
the president and Breckenridge come to camp on
their tour of inspection."</p>

<p>"Could I do some of the work for you, Rod?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Sis, but I'm afraid you'd find it a
Chinese puzzle. I get tangled up in it myself
half the time. We must set down every solitary
item of cost, no matter how trifling; not only
wages and supplies, but breakdowns, time losses,
even those of a few minutes; then calculate our
average, day by day; then plot a curve for each
week's work, showing the cost of the contract for
that week, and set it against our yardage record
for that week. Then verify it, item by item, and
send it in."</p>

<p>"All tied up in beautiful red-tape bow-knots, I
suppose," added Marian, with a sniff. She poked
gingerly into the mass of papers. "The idea of
adding book-keeping to your twelve-hour shift as
superintendent! And in this stuffy, noisy little
box!" She looked impatiently around the close
narrow state-room. The ceiling was not two feet
above her head; the hot morning sunlight beat
on the flat tin roof of the house-boat and dazzled
through the windows. "How can you work here?&mdash;or
sleep, either?"</p>

<p>Rod rubbed his hand uncertainly across his eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't sleep much, for a fact. Too hot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Sometimes I drop off early, but the men always
wake me at midnight when the last shift goes off
duty."</p>

<p>"But the laborers are all across on their own
quarter-boat. They don't come aboard your
house-boat?"</p>

<p>"No, but the quarter-boat is only fifty feet
away. The cook has their hot supper ready at
twelve, and they lark over it, and laugh and shout
and cut up high-jinks, like a pack of school-boys.
I wouldn't mind, only I can't get to sleep again.
I lie there and mull over the contract, you see.
I can't help it."</p>

<p>"Why don't you come up to the Gates farm-house
and sleep there?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of that. It's too far away. I
must stay right here and keep my eye on the work,
every minute. You have no idea what a dangerously
narrow margin of time we have left;
'specially for those north laterals, you know, Sis."
His voice grew sharp and anxious. Marian looked
at him keenly. For the first time she saw the
dull circles under his eyes, the drawn, tired lines
around his steady mouth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>Then she glanced up the ditch. High on its
green stilts, Sally Lou's perky little martin-box
caught her eye.</p>

<p>"I have it, Rod! Tell some of your laborers to
build a cabin for you, like the Burfords'! Then
I'll come down and keep house for you."</p>

<p>Roderick shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I can't spare a solitary laborer from the contract,
Marian; not for a day. We're short-handed
as it is. No, I'll stay where I am. I'm
doing well enough. Steam up, Mulcahy? Good-by,
Sis. Back to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Marian watched the launch till it disappeared in
the green mist of the willows. Then she sat down
to her brother's desk and began to sort the clutter
of papers. But sorting them was not an easy
matter. To her eyes they were only a bewildering
tangle. Marian knew that she possessed an
inborn knack at figures, and it piqued her to find
that she could not master Roderick's accounts at
the first glance. She worked on and on doggedly.
The little state-room grew hot and close; the dull
throb of the dredge machinery and the noisy voices
from without disturbed her more and more.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>At last she sprang up and swept the whole mass
into her hand-bag. Then she ran up the hill to
the martin-box.</p>

<p>Sally Lou, very fresh and cool in pink dimity,
sat in her screened nest, with the babies playing
on the scrubbed floor. She nodded in amused
sympathy at Marian's portentous armful.</p>

<p>"Aren't those records a dismal task! Yes, I've
found a way to sift them, though it took me a long
time to learn. Start by adding up the time-book
accounts; verify each laborer's hours, and see
whether his pay checks correspond to his actual
working time. Roderick has fifty men on his
shift, so that is no small task. Then add up
his memoranda of time made by the big dredge;
and also the daily record of the two little dredges
up at the laterals. Then run over the steward's
accounts and see whether they check with his
bills&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marian stared at Sally Lou, astonished.</p>

<p>"Well, but Sally Lou! Think how much time
that will mean! Why, I would have to spend all
afternoon on the time-books alone."</p>

<p>Sally Lou raised her yellow head and looked at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Marian very steadily. A tiny spark glinted in
her brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, what if it does take all afternoon?
Have you anything better to do?"</p>

<p>There was a minute of silence. Then Marian's
cheeks turned rather pink.</p>

<p>"I suppose not. But it is horridly tedious
work, Sally Lou. On such a warm day, too."</p>

<p>"It certainly is." Sally Lou's voice was quite
dry. She caught up Thomas Tucker, who was
trying laboriously to feed Mr. Finnegan with a
large ball of darning cotton. "You'd find it even
more tedious if you were obliged to work at it
evenings, as your brother does. Can't you stay
to lunch, Marian? We'll love to have you;
won't we, babies?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no. Mrs. Gates will expect me at
home."</p>

<p>Marian walked back through the woods, her
head held high. The glint in Sally Lou's eyes had
been a bit of a challenge. Again she felt her
cheeks flush hot, with a queer puzzled vexation.</p>

<p>"I'll show her that I can straighten Rod's
papers, no matter how muddled they are!" she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
said to herself, tartly. And all that warm spring
afternoon she toiled with might and main.</p>

<p class="p2">Roderick, meanwhile, was spending a hard, discouraging
day. Arriving at Saint Louis, he found
the secretary of the coal-mining company at his
office. Eager and insistent, he poured out his
urgent need of the promised barge-load of coal.
The consignment was now a week overdue. The
dredges had only a few hundred bushels at hand;
in less than forty-eight hours the engines must shut
down, unless he could get the fuel to camp.</p>

<p>"You can't be any more disturbed by this crisis
than I am, Mr. Hallowell," the secretary assured
him. "Owing to a strike at the mines we have
been forced to cancel all deliveries. I can't let
you have a single ton."</p>

<p>Roderick gasped.</p>

<p>"But our dredges! We don't dare shut down.
Our contract has a chilled-steel time-lock, sir,
with a heavy forfeit. We must not run over our
date limits. We've got to have that coal!"</p>

<p>"You may be able to pick up a few tons from
small dealers," said the secretary, turning back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
his desk. "You'll be buying black diamonds in
good earnest, for the retail price has gone up thirty
per cent since the news came of the mines strike.
Wish you good luck, Mr. Hallowell. Sorry that
is all that I can do for you."</p>

<p>Roderick lost no time. He bought a business
directory and hailed a taxicab. For six hours he
drove from one coal-dealer's office to another.
At eight o'clock that night he reached his hotel,
tired in every bone, but in royal high spirits.
Driblet by driblet, and paying a price that fairly
staggered him, he had managed to buy over four
hundred tons.</p>

<p>"That will keep us going till the strike is settled,"
he told Burford over the long-distance.</p>

<p>"Bully for you!" returned Burford, jubilant.
"But how will you bring it up to camp?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the railroad people have promised empties
on to-morrow morning's early freight to Grafton.
Then we can carry it to camp on our own barges.
I shall come up on that freight myself. I shall not
risk losing sight of that coal. Mind that."</p>

<p>At five the next morning Roderick went down
to the freight yards. His coal wagons were already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
arriving. But not one of the promised
"empties" could he find.</p>

<p>"There is a mistake somewhere," said the yard-master.
"Can't promise you a solitary car for
three days, anyway. Traffic is all behindhand.
You'd better make a try at head-quarters."</p>

<p>"I have no time to waste at head-quarters,"
retorted Rod. He was white with anger and
chagrin. This ill luck was a bolt from a clear sky.
"I'll go down to the river front and hire a barge
and a tow-boat. I'll get that coal up to camp to-morrow
if I have to carry it in my suit-case."</p>

<p>His hunt for a barge proved a stern chase, but
finally he secured a large flat-boat at a reasonable
rental. But after searching the river front for
miles, he found only one tow-boat that could be
chartered. The tow's captain, noting Roderick's
anxiety, and learning that he represented the great
Breckenridge Company, promptly declared that
he would not think of doing the two-days' towing
for less than five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars for two days' towing!
And I have already paid three times the mine
price for my coal!" Roderick groaned inwardly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly his eye caught two trim red stacks
and a broad familiar bow not fifty yards away. It
was the little packet, the <i>Lucy Lee</i>. She was just
lowering her gang-plank, making ready to take
on freight for her trip up-stream.</p>

<p>"I'll hail the <i>Lucy</i>. Maybe the captain can
tell me where to find another tow-boat. Ahoy,
the <i>Lucy</i>! Is your captain aboard? Ask him
to come on deck and talk to Hallowell, of the
Breckenridge Company, will you?"</p>

<p>"The captain has not come down yet, sir. But
our pilot, Commodore McCloskey, is here. Will
you talk with him?"</p>

<p>"Will I talk to the commodore? I should hope
so!" Rod's strained face broke into a joyful grin.
He could have shouted with satisfaction when
Commodore McCloskey, trim as a gimlet in
starchy white duck, strolled down the gang-plank
and gave him a friendly hand.</p>

<p>"Sure, I don't wonder ye're red-hot mad," he
said, with twinkling sympathy. "Five hundred
dollars for two days' tow! 'Tis no better than a
pirate that tow-boat captain is, sure. But come
with me. I have a friend at court that can give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
ye a hand, maybe. Hi, boy! Is Captain Lathrop,
of the <i>Queen</i>, round about?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Queen</i>? Why, her captain is the very
man who demanded the five hundred dollars!"
blurted Rod.</p>

<p>At that moment the captain's head popped
from the cabin door. He stared at Roderick. He
stared at Commodore McCloskey. Then he had
the grace to duck wildly back, with a face sheepish
beyond words to describe.</p>

<p>"Well, Captain Lathrop!" Commodore McCloskey's
voice rang merciless and clear. "Tell
me the truth. Is it yourself that's turned highway
robber? Five hundred dollars for twenty
hours' tow! Sure, ye must be one of thim high
fin-an-ciers we read about in the papers. Why
not make it five hundred dollars per ton? Then
ye could sell the <i>Queen</i> and buy yourself a Cunarder
for a tow-boat instead."</p>

<p>Captain Lathrop squirmed.</p>

<p>"How should I know he was a friend of yours,
commodore? I'll take his coal all the way to
camp, and gladly, for three hundred, seein' as it's
a favor to you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>"For three hundred, is it?" The commodore
began a further flow of eloquence. But Rod
caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Three hundred will be all right. And I'm
more obliged to you, commodore, than I can say.
Now I'm off. If ever I can do you a good turn,
mind you give me the chance!"</p>

<p>It was late the next night when Roderick
reached the camp landing with his precious black
diamonds. He was desperately tired, muddy, and
begrimed with smoke and coal-dust, hungry as a
wolf, and hilarious with relief at his hard-earned
success. Marian, Sally Lou, and Burford were all
waiting for him at the little pier. Sally Lou
dragged him up to the martin-box for a late supper.
Afterward Marian, who was to spend the
night with Sally Lou, walked back with him to his
house-boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="illo3" id="illo3"></a>
<img src="images/i_158.jpg" width="362" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"WELL, CAPTAIN LATHROP!" COMMODORE McCLOSKEY'S VOICE
RANG MERCILESS AND CLEAR.</p>
</div>
<p>"Yes, yes, I'm all right, Sis. Don't fidget over
me so." Roderick stepped into his state-room
and dropped down into his desk chair. "Whew!
I'm thankful to get back. I could go to sleep
standing up, if it wasn't for making up the records
for President Sturdevant. Run away now, that's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
a good girl, and let me straighten my accounts.
Then I can go to bed."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke Rod's glance swept his desk.
Instead of the heaped disorder of the day before,
he saw now rows of neatly docketed papers. He
gave a whistle of surprise.</p>

<p>"Who has been overhauling my desk? Burford?
Why&mdash;why, did <i>you</i> do this for me, sister? Well, on
my word, you are just the very best ever." His big
fingers gripped Marian's arm and gave her a grateful
little shake. "You've squared up every single
account, haven't you! And your figuring is always
accurate. This means two hours' extra sleep for
me. Maybe you think I won't enjoy 'em!"</p>

<p>"I might have been keeping your accounts for
you all these weeks," returned Marian. She was
a little mortified by Roderick's astonished gratitude.
"It is not hard work for me. I really enjoyed
doing it."</p>

<p>"Maybe you think I don't enjoy having
you do it!" Rod chuckled contentedly. "I've
dreaded those accounts all day. Now I shall
sleep the sleep of the loafer who has let his sister
do his work for him. Good-night, old lady!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>Marian tucked herself comfortably into her
corner of the martin-box, but not to sleep. Try
her best, she could not banish Rod's tired face from
her mind. Neither could she forget the look of
his little state-room. True, she had made it
daintily fresh and neat. But the tiny box was hot
and stuffy at best. What could she do to make
Rod's quarters more comfortable?</p>

<p>At last she sat up with a whispered exclamation.</p>

<p>"Good! I'll try that plan. Perhaps it won't
do after all. But it cannot hurt to try. And if
my scheme can make Rod the least bit more comfortable,
then the trying will be well worth while!"
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
THE BURGOO</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>Very early the next morning, Marian set to
work upon her brilliant plan for Roderick's comfort.
The coast was clear for action. Both Roderick
and Ned Burford had gone up the canal
to oversee the excavation at the north laterals.
Sally Lou had packed Mammy and the babies
into the buckboard and had driven away to
the nearest farm-house for eggs and butter. So
Marian had a clear field. And she made eager
use of every moment.</p>

<p>Perhaps two hundred yards from the canal
bank, set well up on a little knoll where it could
catch every passing breeze, stood a broad wooden
platform. High posts, built to hold lanterns, were
set at the four corners and half-way down each
side.</p>

<p>"The young folks of the district built that platform
for their picnic dances," Burford had told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Marian. "But this year our dredges have torn
up this whole section and have made the creek
banks so miry and disagreeable that no picnic
parties will come this way till the contract is finished
and the turf has had time to grow again."</p>

<p>Marian measured the platform with a calculating
eye.</p>

<p>"It is built of matched boards, as tight and
sound as if they had put it up yesterday. It will
make a splendid floor for Rod's house. But
when it comes to building the house itself&mdash;that's
the question."</p>

<p>The contract supplies, she knew, were kept in
a store-room built astern of Roderick's house-boat.
For a hot, tiresome hour she poked and pried
through high-piled hogsheads and tiers of boxes,
hoping that she might find a tent. But there was
no such good fortune for her. She dragged out
bale after bale of heavy new canvas. But every
one of the scores of tents provided by the company
was already pitched, to form the summer village
occupied by the levee laborers. At last, quite
vexed and impatient, she gave up her search.</p>

<p>"Although, if I had any knack at all, I could sew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
up a tent from these yards on yards of canvas,"
she reflected.</p>

<p>She carried one bolt of cloth on deck and unrolled
it.</p>

<p>"This is splendid heavy canvas. It is just the
solid, water-proof sort that the fishermen at the
lake last summer used for walls and roof of their
'open-faced camp,' as they called it. Now, I wonder.
Why can't I lash long strips of canvas to the
four posts of the platform for walls; then fasten
heavy wires from one post to another and lash a
slanting canvas roof to that! I can canopy it
with mosquito-bar&mdash;a double layer&mdash;for there are
dozens of yards of netting here. It would be a
ridiculously funny little coop, I know that. But
it would be far cooler and quieter than the boat.
I believe Rod would like it. Anyway, we'll see!"</p>

<p>Jacobs, the commissary man, came aboard a
few minutes later with a basket of clean linen. He
looked at Marian, already punching eyelet-holes
in the heavy duck, with friendly concern.</p>

<p>"Best let me give you a lift at that job, miss,"
he urged, when Marian had told him her plans.
"I have an hour off, and I shall be pleased to help,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
if you will permit me. I'm an old sailor and I
have my needle and palm in my kit. That kind
of fancy work is just pastime to me. Indeed, I'd
enjoy doing anything, if it's for Mr. Hallowell.
We've never had a better boss, that's certain. You
lace those strips of duck, then I'll hang them for
you. We'll curtain off just a half of the platform.
That will leave the other half for a fine open porch.
We'll have this house built in two jiffies. Then
I'll put Mr. Hallowell's canvas cot and his desk
and his chair into place, all ready; so when he
comes home to-night he will find himself moved
and settled."</p>

<p>It took longer than two jiffies to lash up the canvas
shack, to hang mosquito bar, and to move
Roderick's simple furniture. Returning from
their drive, Sally Lou and Mammy Easter hurried
to help; and, thanks to many willing hands,
the tiny new abode was finished by afternoon;
even to the brackets for Rod's lamp, which
Jacobs screwed into a corner post, and the rack
for his towels.</p>

<p>At six o'clock, Roderick, fagged out and spattered
with mud, came down the canal. He would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
have gone directly aboard his house-boat if Marian
had not called him ashore.</p>

<p>"March up here and see my out-door sitting-room,"
she commanded, with laughing eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you and Sally Lou have made a play-house
of that platform? That's all very nice. But wait
till I can scrub up and swallow a mouthful of supper,
Sis. My skiff tipped over with me up the canal,
and I'm soaking wet, and dead tired besides."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Rod. Please come up right away. I
can't wait, Slow-Coach. You really must see!"</p>

<p>Roderick was well used to Marian's imperious
whims. Reluctantly he climbed the slippery
bank. Obediently he poked his head past the flap
which Marian held back for him.</p>

<p>There he saw his own cot spread white and
fresh under its cool screen; his tidy desk; and
even a "shower-bath," which clever Jacobs had
contrived from a tiny force-pump and a small galvanized
tank, borrowed from the company's
store-room.</p>

<p>For a long minute he stared about him without
one word. Then his tired face brightened to a
glow of incredulous delight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>"Marian Hallowell! Did you rig up this whole
contrivance, all for me? Well!" He sank down
on the cot with a sigh of infinite satisfaction.
"You certainly are the best sister I ever had, old
lady. First you take my book-keeping off my
hands. Next you build me a brand-new house,
where I can sleep&mdash;&mdash;whew! Won't I sleep like
a log to-night, in all this quiet and coolness! On
my word, I don't believe I could stand up to my
work, Sis, if you didn't help me out as you do."</p>

<p>Marian grew radiant at his pleasure.</p>

<p>"Building it was no end of fun, Rod. I never
enjoyed anything more."</p>

<p>"Only I hope you haven't tired yourself out,"
said her brother, suddenly anxious. "You haven't
the strength to work like this."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You don't realize how much
stronger I am, Rod."</p>

<p>"You surely do look a hundred per cent better
than you did a month ago." Roderick looked at
her with keen satisfaction. "But you must not
overtire yourself."</p>

<p>"Don't be so fussy, brother. It was just a
trifle, anyway."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>"It won't mean a trifle to me. Quiet and sleep
will give me a chance to get my head above water
and breathe. Hello, neighbors!" For Sally Lou
and Ned were poking their unabashed heads
through the fly. "Come in and see my new mansion.
Guess I'll have to give a house-warming to
celebrate. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"There's a celebration already on the way,"
laughed Burford. "Commodore McCloskey has
just called me up on the long-distance. He says
that he and Mrs. McCloskey will stop at the camp
bright and early to-morrow morning to escort your
sister and Sally Lou to the Barry County burgoo.
I accepted the invitation for both you girls, for
a 'burgoo,' whatever it means, sounds like a jolly
lark; especially since the commodore is to be your
host. But I'll admit that I'm puzzled. What
do you suppose a burgoo may be?"</p>

<p>The four looked at each other.</p>

<p>"It sounds rather like a barbecue," ventured
Sally Lou.</p>

<p>"Hoots! It is far too early in the spring for a
barbecue."</p>

<p>"Burgoo? <i>Barbecue?</i>" Marian spoke the mystic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
words over, bewildered. "What is a barbecue,
pray? Two such grim, ferocious words I never
heard."</p>

<p>"A barbecue is a country-side picnic, where the
company unite to buy a huge piece of beef;
sometimes a whole ox. Then they roast it in a
trench floored with hot stones. The usual time
for a barbecue is in August. Then they add roasting
ears and new potatoes to the beef, and have a
dinner fit for a king."</p>

<p>"Or for an ogre," returned Marian. "It sounds
like a feast for giants. Yet a burgoo sounds even
fiercer and more barbaric. I shall ask the commodore
what it means, the minute he comes.
Wasn't he a dear to think of taking us?"</p>

<p>Bright and early, even as he had promised,
Mr. McCloskey's trig little launch puffed up to
the camp landing. The commodore, arrayed as
Solomon in snowy linen, a red tie, and a large
Panama, waved greeting. Beside him sat Mrs.
McCloskey, her sweet little old face beaming
under her crisp frilled sunbonnet.</p>

<p>The two girls stepped aboard, with Finnegan
prancing joyfully after. For to-day the Burford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
babies were to stay at home with Mammy, while
Finnegan was to attend the burgoo, a specially
bidden guest.</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. McCloskey! Tell us quick!
What may a burgoo be?"</p>

<p>"A burgoo?" Commodore McCloskey reflected.
"Well, then, so ye don't know a burgoo by experience.
Wherever was ye brought up? A
burgoo is a burgoo, sure. 'Tis the only word in
the English language that describes it. 'Tis sack-races,
an' pole-climbin', an' merry-go-rounds, an'
pink limonade, an' a brass band, an' kettles full of
b'iled chicken an' gravy, an' more mortial things
to eat than the tongue of man can name. Ye
must see it to understand the real po'try of it.
For the half of it could not be told to you."</p>

<p>The commodore was quite right. The burgoo
was all that he had claimed, and more. At least
two hundred people, gay in their Sunday best, had
already gathered at the county picnic grounds, a
beautiful open woodland several miles up the
Illinois River. Vendors of candy and popcorn,
toy balloons and pink lemonade, shouted their
wares. A vast merry-go-round wheezed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
sputtered; the promised brass band awoke the
river echoes. And, swung in a mighty rank
above a row of camp-fires cleverly built in a
broad shallow trench, the burgoo kettles sizzled
and steamed.</p>

<p>"Burgoo," the girls soon learned, is the local
name for a delicious stew of chicken and bacon
and vegetables, cooked slowly for hours, then
served in wooden bowls with huge dill pickles
and corn pone. Sally Lou, housekeeper born,
wheedled the head cook, a courteous, grizzled
old negro, into giving her the recipe. Marian,
chuckling inwardly, heard his painstaking reply.</p>

<p>"Yes'um. I kin tell you jest how to go about
makin' burgoo. First you want sixteen, maybe
twenty, pounds of bacon, cut tolerable fine. Then
four dozen chickens won't be too many. Start
your meats a-b'ilin'. Then peel your taters&mdash;I
used three bushel for this batch. Then put in
tomatoes. I reckon two dozen cans might do,
though three would be better. Then cabbage, an'
beans, an' onions, if you like. Two dozen head
of cabbage is about right. An' two bushels of
beans&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>Just then Sally Lou dropped her pencil in
despair.</p>

<p>"I'll be no more than a head of cabbage myself,
if I keep on trying to reduce this recipe to
the needs of two people," she groaned in desperation.
"Come along, Marian, let's climb on the
merry-go-round a while and see if it won't clear
my addled brain."</p>

<p>The merry-go-round proved delightfully thrilling,
especially to Mr. Finnegan, who rode round
and round in a gilded sea-shell, barking himself
hoarse in dizzy ecstasy.</p>

<p>Just before noon the crowd, now astonishingly
large, gathered at the little running track to watch
the sports. First came the sack-races; then the
pole-climbing; then the potato-race. Finnegan,
by this time delirious with excitement, had to be
held down by main force to discourage his wild
ambition to take an active part in each event.
Last on the programme came the greased-pig race.</p>

<p>Now, the greased-pig race dates back a hundred
years and more, to the days when the Kentucky
pioneers met for their rare frolics of house-raising
or corn-husking. It is a quaint old sport, very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
rough, very grimy and breathless, very ridiculously
funny. A lively little pig is chosen and
greased with melted tallow from head to tail.
Then he is set free on the running-track. Half a
minute later, the starting-gun booms the signal
for his hunters to dash in pursuit. The winner
must capture piggy with his bare hands and carry
the squirming, slippery armful back to the judges'
stand. If piggy escapes en route, the race must be
run over again from the very start.</p>

<p>The competitors are boys and young men.
Only the fleet-footed can hope for a chance at
success. But even as the starter stood calling the
race through his big red megaphone, a tall, elderly
man shouldered up to their group and hailed Mr.
McCloskey.</p>

<p>"Good-day, commodore! You're here to see
the greased-pig race? My faith, do you remember
the race that we two ran, down in Pike
County in '63?"</p>

<p>The commodore beamed at his old neighbor.</p>

<p>"'Deed an' I do. And it was meself that captured
that elegant pig, I remember."</p>

<p>"You did that. But it was by accident entirely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
For I had all but laid my hand on the
pig when you snatched it from under my grasp.
I've grudged ye that pig ever since."</p>

<p>The little commodore's eyes snapped. He
bristled from the crest of his white head to the
toes of his polished boots. His voice took on an
ominously silver tone.</p>

<p>"By my word, I'm sorry to learn that that
small pig has stood between us all these years,
Mister Jennings. If it could give you satisfaction,
I'd beg you to run that race over again with
me. Or, we might race each other in the contest
that is just about to take place. What do
ye say?"</p>

<p>For a minute, the astounded Mr. Jennings found
nothing whatever to say.</p>

<p>"Now, commodore!" protested gentle Mrs. McCloskey,
round-eyed with reproach. "You'd not
think of runnin' a half mile this hot noon in the face
of all your friends an' neighbors, an' all for one small
pig! And you seventy last month, an' that suit
of clothes bought new from Saint Louis not the
fortnight ago!"</p>

<p>"You don't understand, Mary. I'd run the race
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
if there was no pig at all under consideration, so
it would give my friend Mister Jennings peace of
mind," said the little commodore hotly. "What
do ye say, sir? Will you join me, an' prove once
more which one of us is the rale winner?"</p>

<p>Very red and disconcerted, Mr. Jennings stood
on one foot, then the other, in a torture of indecision.
Then he threw off his coat.</p>

<p>"I've never taken a dare like that yet, McCloskey.
And I don't begin now. Come along."</p>

<p>"Commodore!" Poor Mrs. McCloskey's
shocked voice pursued him. But the commodore
would not hear. Mr. Jennings was already clambering
the rail to the running-track. Lightly as a
boy, the commodore vaulted after him. Shoulder
to shoulder the two joined the group before
the judges' stand.</p>

<p>There ran a ripple of question through the
crowd, then a storm of delighted cheers and
laughter. Mr. Jennings wriggled in sheepish torment.
The commodore, sparkling and debonair,
bowed to the throng and hung his Panama on a
fence-post.</p>

<p>Then down the running-track fled a small,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
shiny black object, squealing in glad escape. Instantly
a shot crashed; then came a thundering
shout:</p>

<p>"Ready&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>With whoops and yells the group of runners
raced away down the track. The commodore
kept well in the lead. He ran as lightly and as
easily as did the boys that forged alongside him.
Mr. Jennings puffed and pounded farther in the
rear at every turn. They made the first lap of the
race. At the second turn the commodore, only
third from the lead, waved his hand to Mrs. McCloskey
and the girls with a flourish of mischievous
triumph. Marian and Sally Lou, tearful and
choking with delight, clasped hands and swayed
together in helpless rapture. Thus completely
absorbed in the spectacle, they let go of Mr.
Finnegan's leash.</p>

<p>That was all that Finnegan wanted. With one
glad yelp he hurled himself through the fence and
bounced like a ball, straight into the midst of the
fray. Far in advance fled a shiny black object.
Finnegan knew his duty. The commodore was
hurrying to catch that object. It was Finnegan's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
part to aid in that capture at all costs. Yelping
madly, he tore away down the track.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's Finnegan! Oh, the little villain! If
I had only left him at home!" Poor Marian
strove to call him back. But against the uproar
of the crowd her voice could not make a sound.
"Oh, the naughty little sinner, he will catch that
pig himself and spoil the race for everybody.
Look, Sally Lou! He has almost caught up with
the pig this minute!"</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, Finnegan, running at top
speed, shot ahead of the fleeing pig. Then, with
a frenzied bark, he whirled and charged straight
at the prize.</p>

<p>This front attack was too much for any pig's
self-control. Not content with galloping murderously
at his heels, his pursuers had set this ferocious
brute to destroy him! With a squeal of
mortal panic the little fellow turned right-about
and bolted. Shrieking, he dashed back, straight
into the crowd of runners.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh! He's right under the commodore's
hand! Oh, if he wasn't so slippery&mdash;Look,
quick, Marian!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, will you look at that now!" Mrs. McCloskey's
mild voice rose in a laugh of triumph.
"Sure, I never yet knew the commodore to fail
if once he'd set his head to do a thing!"</p>

<p>"If only he can keep fast hold of the pig till he
reaches the judges' stand," whispered Sally Lou.
All three gazed in pale suspense at the commodore,
now striding gayly up the race-track, the pig
squirming and squealing wildly in his arms.</p>

<p>"I'm mistrustin' that myself," said Mrs. McCloskey,
nervously, "for the little animal is not
so convenient to hold, bein' he's so glassy smooth.
But trust the commodore. He'll not fail, now."</p>

<p>The commodore did not fail. Calm and majestic,
as if he strode a quarter-deck, he paced down
the track and halted before the judges' stand, his
shrieking prize held high. As the umpire bent
forward to give him the champion's blue ribbon,
the crowd broke loose. No Olympic victor ever
received his laurel in the face of a more enthusiastic
tumult.</p>

<p>"I give up," puffed Mr. Jennings, fanning himself
with his hat. "You caught that pig fair an'
square, commodore. The honors are yours."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>"Tut, tut, 'twas no great matter," declared the
commodore modestly, as the girls heaped him
with praises. "'Twas just a moment's divarsion.
And it took no skill whatever, though I will own
that to carry the little felly back to the judges'
stand demanded some effort on me part. You
will observe that a pig furnishes but few handholds,
particularly when he's that slippery and
excited-like. Yes, Mary, perhaps we'd best be
startin' home, as it's so near sundown."</p>

<p>"Well, but these girls must not go home empty-handed,"
urged Mrs. McCloskey. "Think of
your poor boys, who could not take a day off for
the burgoo! We must carry home a taste for them.
Go to yonder booth and buy a market-basket,
commodore. Then we'll pack in a few samples."</p>

<p>Marian and Sally Lou looked on in silent amaze
while Mrs. McCloskey packed the few samples,
including a tall jar of the delicious burgoo, a dazzling
array of cookies and preserves, and a fat
black-currant pie. Meanwhile the commodore
was fitting his treasured pig neatly into a small
crate, much to the dismay of the pig and the
keen joy of a large group of on-lookers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>At last basket and crate were made ready.
Tired out by their long, absurd, delightful day, the
party settled themselves aboard the commodore's
launch and started home. The trip downstream
to camp was made in rapid time. It was just
dusk when they reached their own landing.
Roderick and Ned Burford had heard the commodore's
whistle and were waiting to help them
ashore.</p>

<p>"What sort of a day was it, Sis?"</p>

<p>"Yes, tell us, quick, if you had any fun. We
have put in a gruelling day of it here," added
Burford. "Three break-downs on the little dredge
and a threatened cave-in on the first lateral! Go
on and tell us something cheerful."</p>

<p>Marian and Sally Lou stole a glance backward.
The commodore was just putting his boat into
mid-stream. He was safely out of earshot. With
almost tearful laughter the two girls poured out
the story of the day.</p>

<p>"You brought home the best of the day to us,"
said Ned, as they spread the "samples" on a tiny
deck table, picnic-fashion. "We fellows only laid
off our levee shifts a few minutes ago. We're
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
rushing that construction before the creeks rise
any higher. So neither of us has eaten a mouthful
since noon. This luncheon will taste like
manna in the desert. S'pose Mammy Easter
would make us a pot of coffee, Sally Lou? Then
we could ask no more."</p>

<p>"I'll go to the cabin and coax her to do it. I
want a peep at the babies, anyway."</p>

<p>Sally Lou sprang up and started toward the
gangway. At the cabin door she stopped short.
Her voice rang out, a frightened cry.</p>

<p>"Ned Burford! Come quick! What is that
blazing light away up the ditch? Is it&mdash;Oh,
it is one of the boats&mdash;it is the big dredge! And
it is on fire!"</p>

<p>Ned Burford leaped up. His startled voice
echoed Sally Lou's cry.</p>

<p>"Hallowell! It's the big dredge, the giant Garrison!
Wake up and pitch in. Hurry!"</p>

<p>Days afterward Marian would try to recall
just what happened during those wild moments;
but the whole scene would flicker before her memory,
a dizzy blur. She remembered Roderick's
shout of alarm; the rush of the day-shift men from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
their tents; the clatter of the racing engine as
Rod pushed them into the launch, then sent the
little boat flying away up the canal. Then,
directly ahead, she could see that dense black pillar
of smoke rising straight up from the dredge
deck, shot through with spurts of flame.</p>

<p>Burford's half-strangled voice came back to
them as he groped his way across the deck.</p>

<p>"It's a pile of burning waste, right here by the
capstan. Bring the chemical-extinguishers ...
no time to wait for the hose.... Wet your coats,
boys, and let's pound her out.... Whe-ew!
I'm 'most strangled.... Sally Lou Burford!
<i>You clear out!</i> You and Marian, too. Go away,
I tell you. This is no place for you!"</p>

<p>Sally Lou and Marian stood doggedly in line
passing the buckets of water which one of the
laborers was dipping up from over the side.
Roderick, stolid as a rock, stood close by that
choking column of smoke and flame and dashed
on the water. Burford rushed about, everywhere
at once, half mad with excitement, yet giving
orders with unswerving judgment.</p>

<p>"Can't you start the pumping engine, boys?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Swing out that emergency hose, quick. There
you are! Now turn that stream on those oil
barrels yonder&mdash;and <i>keep</i> it there. Start the big
force-pump and train a stream on the deck near
the engines. The fire mustn't spread to the
hoisting-gear. Mind that. Mulcahy, give me
that chemical-tank. Wet my handkerchief and
tie it over my mouth, Sally Lou. No, give me
your scarf. That's better. I'm going to wade
right in. Aha! See that?"</p>

<p>The smoke column wavered, thinned. A shower
of water, soot, and chemicals drenched everybody
on deck. Nobody noticed the downpour, for the
smoke column was sinking with every moment.</p>

<p>Burford staggered back, half smothered. The
extinguisher fell from his hand. But the force-pumps
were working now at full blast. Stream
after stream of water poured on the fire, then
flooded across the deck. Two minutes more of
frantic, gasping work and not a spark remained&mdash;nothing
save the heap of quenched, still smoking
waste.</p>

<p>Dazed, Marian found herself once more on the
house-boat deck. Ashore the laborers were flocking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
back to their tents, laughing and shouting.
For them it had been a frolic rather than a danger.
But the four on the house-boat deck looked at
each other without a word. They were too shaky
with relief to move or to speak. Sally Lou, the
steady-willed, dependable Sally Lou, clung trembling
to Marian, who in her turn leaned rather
weakly against the rail. Roderick, ashen white,
confronted Burford, who stood absently mopping
his wet, smarting eyes with Sally Lou's singed and
dripping crpe scarf. Suddenly Burford broke the
tension with a strangled whoop.</p>

<p>"Our&mdash;our daily reports to the company!"
he gurgled. "President Sturdevant wants every
day's detail. Let's put it all in. 'I have the honor
to report that while your engineers were stoking
with burgoo and black-currant pie, Garrison
Dredge Number Three was observed to be on fire.
Your engineers, assisted by their partners, said
engineers' wife and sister, all of whom displayed
conspicuous bravery, attacked the fire. Thanks
to their heroic efforts, the conflagration was extinguished.
I beg further to report that damages
are confined to one pile of waste, one smooched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
pink silk scarf, and'"&mdash;he passed his hand over
his smutty forehead&mdash;"'and one pair of eyebrows.'"</p>

<p>"I'm going straight home to bed," vowed
Marian, as the laughter died away in exhausted
chuckles. "This day has brought so many
thrilling events that it will take me at least a week
to calm myself down. Do let us hope that nothing
whatever will happen for a while. I'm longing
for monotony&mdash;days, months, ages of monotony,
at that!"</p>

<p>And, even as she spoke, there was a shout
from the pier. Mulcahy came running toward
them at top speed.</p>

<p>"Will you look at Mulcahy, sprinting up from
the ditch! I'll wager he has some more bad news
for us. Come, Hallowell. Hurry!"
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
THE MAGIC LEAD-PENCIL</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>"Bad news, is it?" puffed Mulcahy. "Indeed,
sir, I'm sorry to be the one to bring it to you.
Lateral Four has caved in again."</p>

<p>"Lateral Four! The cut where we've spent
more time and work, filling in, than we've spent
anywhere else on the whole ditch!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lateral Four. The ungrateful piece of
fill she is! And when you have shored up the margins
with brush, twice over!"</p>

<p>"How far up is the cave-in, Mulcahy?"</p>

<p>"Half a mile from the mouth. Right where
Mr. Ellingworth Locke's land begins, sir."</p>

<p>"Right on President Locke's land! Will you
hear that, Hallowell? And he's the biggest grumbler
in the whole district! And the most powerful
grumbler, too. Of all the hard luck!"</p>

<p>"I do hear. And I'm going to get busy."
Rod pulled himself together with a grim little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
chuckle. "It's an all-night job, Burford. Or
else we can add one more calamity to our head-quarters
report. 'One bad cave-in, on lateral
draining land owned by H. R. H., the acting
president of the Central Mississippi Association.'
Do you see us putting in that cheery news?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. Not just yet." Burford wiped
the last soot-streak from his chin and jumped into
the launch. "Here we go!"</p>

<p>"Wait a jiffy, Burford. You'd better stay by
the dredge an hour or so. Keep the men at work
flooding her deck. We can't be certain-sure that
the fire is completely out. There's always a
risk."</p>

<p>"That's a fact. You go up to the cave-in
and set the levee crews to work. I'll follow in an
hour."</p>

<p>Rod started his engine, but Marian stopped
him.</p>

<p>"Wait, Rod. Take me up to the lateral, too."</p>

<p>"Take you up to the cave-in, you mean?
Why on earth should you go? At this time of
night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because I want to see just what you have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
do. I'm getting very much interested in the
work, truly. Please, brother."</p>

<p>"Of all the notions!" Rod looked completely
puzzled. Yet a warm little gratified smile brightened
his tired face. Again he felt the heart-warming
satisfaction that he had felt on the day
he had come home, fagged and blue, to find that
Marian had sorted all his accounts and cleared
up his reports for him. It was wonderfully pleasant
to find that his sister could show such real
comradeship in his work.</p>

<p>"Of course you shall go with me if you wish,
dear. Hop in. Careful!"</p>

<p>"Let me steer, Rod."</p>

<p>"Think you can see all right?"</p>

<p>"With this big search-light? I should hope so.
Lie down on the cushions and rest for two minutes.
I'll run very carefully."</p>

<p>"Good enough." Rod stretched his weary
bones on the seat. At the end of the six-mile run
he sat up, with a shamed grin.</p>

<p>"Lazy sinner I am, I dropped off the minute I
struck those cushions. My, that snooze makes one
thirsty for more! Put the launch inshore, Sis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Hello there, boys! Is that Dredge A crew? Why,
how did you swing the dredge downstream so
quickly?"</p>

<p>"We had steam up, so we dropped down the
lateral the minute we got word of the cave-in,"
answered the dredge foreman. "It was Mister
Jim Conover who happened by and saw the landslip,
sir. He came a-gallopin' over with his horse
all lather, and brought us the news, not fifteen
minutes after it happened. Then he called his
own hired men and a crowd of neighbors, and they
all set to to shore up the bank, above and below
the break, with sand-bags and brush. They're
workin' at it now, sir, lickety-cut." He pointed
up the lateral to a dim glow of torch-light. "Shovellin'
away like beavers they are, sir. There won't
be another slump in that margin, you can depend
on that. They've saved you and the company
two days' work and five hundred dollars clear in
damages alone, I'm thinkin'."</p>

<p>"Five hundred damages? It would have been
nearer a thousand if they hadn't stopped that
slide on the double-quick." Roderick sat staring
at the hurrying figures in the dull glow of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
smoky light. He could hardly grasp this amazing
stroke of fortune. "But how&mdash;why&mdash;I never
heard of such a royal piece of kindness!"</p>

<p>"It's all Conover's doing. He said you folks
had done mighty neighborly by him, and that he
wanted to show his appreciation."</p>

<p>"<i>Conover!</i> Why, I never even heard the man's
name till now!"</p>

<p>"Conover?" Marian screwed up her forehead.
A vague recollection flickered in her mind.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Conover. He has a good-sized farm
back here a piece. Likely you've forgotten.
There's him and his wife and his little girl. Crippled
she is, the poor child. Mamie, they call her."</p>

<p>"Mamie Conover&mdash;Oh! The poor little soul
who was so delighted with your red pencils, Rod!
That visitors' Sunday, don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure. You're better at remembering
than I am, Sis. Well, I'm going up to thank him,
this minute. Then we'll ship the dredge into
trim and begin digging out the channel again.
Think it will take us all night?"</p>

<p>"Now that Conover's gang has stopped the
slide so good and square for us, we ought to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
able to cut out and tamp down, too, by daybreak,
sir. Maybe sooner. Here comes Conover this
minute."</p>

<p>Coated with mud, squashing heavily into the
sodden crest of the bank with every step, Conover
tramped down the ditch. In that shambling
figure, Marian instantly recognized little Mamie's
father. Vividly she remembered his deep, weary
look at her, the infinite tenderness with which he
had lifted the little frail body from her arms.</p>

<p>In the white glare of the search-light, his gaunt
face was radiant with friendly concern.</p>

<p>"We've done what little we could, Mr. Hallowell,"
he said, in reply to Rod's eager thanks.
"Little enough at that. But now if you'll put in
a few hours' dredging to get out that slide, your
ditch will be all right again. Mr. Locke there,
whose land borders on this lateral, is a little&mdash;well,
a little fussy, you know. That's why we fellows
kinder butted in and set to work without
waitin' to hear from you. Land, it wasn't nothing
to thank us for. Just a little troke between
neighbors. You here, Miss Hallowell? My buckboard
is right up-shore. Can't I drive you to Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Gates's? It's right on my way home&mdash;only a
mile or so off my road, that is."</p>

<p>"Run along, Sis. Please. It's late and damp,
and chilly besides. Scoot, now."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to go, Rod. I want to stay
and see the dredge make the cut over again. This
is the most interesting performance I ever dreamed
of."</p>

<p>"I'd much rather have you go home, old lady.
You can't see much in this half-light. And you
can't help me. Worse, you'll catch cold sure and
certain." Yet that odd little glow warmed Rod's
heart once more. It was a wonderful satisfaction
to hear Marian speak with such keen interest of
his beloved work.</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;" reluctantly Marian scrambled
ashore. Mr. Conover wiped his muddy hands on
the lap-robe and helped her into the buckboard,
with awkward care. They drove swiftly away,
up the wide country road, between the dark, level
fields.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for some minutes. At last
Marian began, rather clumsily, to tell him of their
exciting day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>The man made no comment. Still more clumsily,
she tried to thank him for his generous and
timely aid to Roderick.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Conover turned to her. In the
faint starlight she saw that his dull face was
working painfully.</p>

<p>"So you want to thank me for this job, eh?
Why, if I'd done ten times as much, I wouldn't
have begun to do what I want to do for you and
your brother. I've been aimin' to come over and
tell you, long ago. But seems like I never get
around to it. Don't you mind about them red
pencils?"</p>

<p>"Those red and blue pencils of Rod's, you mean?
What of them?"</p>

<p>"What of them? My, if you could see Mamie
with them, you wouldn't ask!" The color burned
in his thin face. His eyes were shining now.
"They're the one pleasure that ain't never failed
her. If I could ever tell you what they've meant!
I've sent to the city and bought her three or four
dozen assorteds, so's to be sure she never gets short
of all the colors. No matter how bad her back
hurts, she'll set there in her pillows and mark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
away, happy's a kitten. Seems like long's she's
workin' with those pencils, she forgets everything,
even the pain. And that's the best we can ever
do for our baby." His voice broke on a terrible
and piteous note. "The only thing we can do&mdash;help
her forget."</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"An' then you talk as if what I did to-night
could count for anything&mdash;alongside of <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>Marian's own lips were quivering. She did not
dare to reply.</p>

<p>Yet as she put out her bedroom candle and
stood looking out on the dark starlit woods, the
narrow black ribbon of the canal, a whimsical
wonder stirred in her thought.</p>

<p>"I'll tell Rod to-morrow that his red pencils
must have the credit of it all. It's the story of
the little Dutch hero who stuffed his thumb into
the crack in the dike and saved the city, right
over again. Only this time it's something even
tinier than a thumb that has saved the day. It's
just a little red lead-pencil. And, oh, how glad
I am for Roderick's sake! The dear, stodgy old
slow-coach, I'm proud of every inch of his success.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Though maybe Slow-Coach isn't just the fitting
name for Rod nowadays. Sometimes the slow
coaches are the very ones that win the race&mdash;in
the long run."
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
HONORED GUESTS</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>Marian's wish for quiet and monotonous days
was promptly granted. Only too promptly and
too thoroughly, she owned ruefully. The next
morning dawned bleak and gray, with a chill east
wind and a driving rain. Held prisoner in the
house by the storm, Marian amused herself
through the long dreary day as best she could.
At supper-time, feeling very lonely indeed, she
called Roderick up on the telephone; but their
long-distance visit gave her little satisfaction.</p>

<p>Roderick had spent a hard day, hurrying from
one lateral to another, crowding the levee work to
the highest possible speed; for in this wide-spread
rain the creeks to the north were rising an inch an
hour, and every inch meant danger to his half-built
embankments. Marian sympathized eagerly
and declared that she would come down to the
canal the next day and help him with his reports.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"Not if it rains you won't," croaked Roderick
hoarsely. "Don't let me catch you outside the
house. You'll catch cold just as I have done, wading
through this swamp. Mind, now. Don't you
dare leave the farm-house unless it clears."</p>

<p>Marian promised. When the morning came,
dark and drizzly, she found it hard to keep her
word. The hours went on leaden feet. The downpour
never slackened. It was impossible for her
to go out-doors even as far as the driveway. In
that flat, low country a two-days' rain means an
inundation. Meadows and fields were like flooded
marshes. Sheets of water spread through the
orchards; the yard paths were so many brooks,
the barn-yard was an infant lake.</p>

<p>"It won't last very long," Mrs. Gates consoled
her. "A year ago we'd have been heart-broken
at the sight of such a rain. It would have meant
ruin for all the crops. The surplus water would
not have drained off in a fortnight. But since
they began digging the ditches, we know that our
crops will be safe, even if it rains for a week."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to learn that Rod's hard work counts
for something," said Marian impatiently. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
flattened her downcast face against the pane.
"In the meantime, I feel like a marooned pirate.
If I can't get out of doors for some fresh air
before long, I'll develop a pirate's disposition,
too."</p>

<p>At dusk she tried again to call Roderick on
the telephone, to demand sympathy for her imprisonment.
But to her astonishment she could
get no reply from central.</p>

<p>"The wires are all down, I dare say," said Mrs.
Gates cheerfully. "It'll be three or four days before
the line-men can get around to repair
damages. The roads are hub deep. No telling
when they can haul their repair wagons through.
You'll see."</p>

<p>Marian did see. The district roads had been
all but impassable ever since her coming. Now,
thanks to this downpour, they would be bottomless
pits of mire.</p>

<p>"Well! It's worse this morning, if anything,"
Mrs. Gates announced cheerfully, as Marian appeared
on the third gray morning. "'Pears to
me that you won't get out-doors again before the
Fourth of July."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>"But I must have some air. I can't stay cooped
up forever," cried Marian. "If you'd only lend
me your rubber boots, Mrs. Gates; the ones you
wear when you're gardening. Then I could put
on my mackintosh and my rubber bathing-cap and
splash about beautifully. Besides, I must go down
to the canal. I must see how Rod is getting on.
Think, it has been two days since I have heard one
word from him. Yet he is barely two miles
away!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gates yielded at last to her coaxing. Soon
Marian started out, wearing the borrowed boots
and Mr. Gates's oil-skin coat. She stumbled and
splashed away through the dripping woods, with
Finnegan romping gayly behind. Rainy weather
held no melancholy for Finnegan. Shut in the
house, he had made those three days memorable
for the household, especially for poor irate Empress,
who had taken refuge at last on the top
rafter of the corn-bin. On the way to camp he
flushed three rabbits, chased a fat gray squirrel
into chattering fury, and dragged Marian knee-deep
into a bog, in his wild eagerness to dig out
an imaginary woodchuck.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I had a little of your vim, Finnegan."
Marian sat down, soaked and breathless, on the
step of Sally Lou's martin-box. From that eminence
she surveyed the canal and its swarms of
laborers. Her eyes clouded.</p>

<p>In spite of her growing interest in Roderick's
work, to look upon that work always puzzled her
and disheartened her. The slow black water; the
ugly mud-piled banks; the massive engines throbbing
night and day through a haze of steam; the
gigantic dredge machines, swinging their great steel
arms back and forth, up and down, lifting tons of
earth from the bottom of the ditch and placing it
on the waiting barge with weird, unerring skill.
Most of all, the heavy tide of hurry and anxiety
that seemed to rise higher every day. All these
things vexed her and harassed her. When Rod
talked over his work with her with all his eager
enthusiasm, she could share his triumph or lament
his disappointment, as the case might be. But
the work itself was so huge, so complicated, that
she could never quite grasp it. She could never
understand her brother's passionate interest.</p>

<p>"Although I don't despise the very sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
camp, as I did at first," she reflected. "It is
rather queer that I don't, too. Perhaps one can
get used to anything. And I do want to learn
more about Rod's work, for he loves it so dearly,
and I know he wants me to enjoy it too. Though
how anybody can enjoy such a life! To spend
day after day, month on month, toiling like a
slave in a steaming marsh like this!"</p>

<p>A brisk finger tapped on the window-pane above
her.</p>

<p>"Come in, Miss Northerner! Poor dear, you're
all but drowned. Stand on the oil-cloth and drip
till Mammy can help you to take off those boots
and put on my slippers."</p>

<p>Marian entered the dry, warm little house with
a sigh of pleasure. Presently she sat at the window
with Thomas Tucker bouncing on her knee.
Thomas Tucker had charms that could cheer the
most pensive spirit. Yet Marian stared soberly
past his bobbing yellow head at the swarming
camp below.</p>

<p>"Don't look so droopy, Miss Northerner. Perk
up, do!" Sally Lou gave her ear a gentle nip.
"You and I will have to manufacture cheerfulness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
in car-load lots this week, to counterbalance our
partners' gloom."</p>

<p>"Why? Have the boys met with more ill-luck
on the contract?"</p>

<p>"More ill-luck!" Sally Lou checked off point
by point on her slim fingers. "Day before yesterday&mdash;the
morning after the fire&mdash;the district inspector
was due here to pass judgment on the two
upper laterals. As you know, the contract provides
that the inspector must look over every yard
of excavation and approve it before it can be considered
as actually done. Lo and behold, no inspector
appeared. The boys were wild with anxiety
to start their levee-work before the rain
should wash the soft new banks down into the
canal; for the company is responsible for every
cave-in, and every slide of land means double
labor in digging all that soil out of the ditch again.
By noon the inspector had not been heard from,
but two small cave-ins had occurred, and the
company was losing money at the rate of thirty
dollars an hour, because of the enforced idleness of
the laborers and the shutting down of the machinery.
Finally Roderick took his launch and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
started out in search of the inspector. At Grafton
he managed to get telephone connections with his
office, and he was cheerfully assured that the inspector
would appear on the scene 'as soon as the
rain stops.'"</p>

<p>"'As soon as the rain stops?' Why, Sally Lou!
Then he hasn't come at all!"</p>

<p>"Precisely. Back came poor Rod, very cross
and doleful indeed. Then he and Ned gave up
work on the laterals and set the men to hacking
away at the regular excavation. The laborers are
sulky accordingly. Yesterday they threatened a
strike. I don't blame them. The bank-cutting
is all very well in dry weather, but in this rain it
is a miserable task."</p>

<p>"Well, Rod can keep the men pacified. He's
a splendid manager."</p>

<p>"Yes; and the men like him. But the work
is terribly wearing on both the boys. And the
third calamity arrived last night. The dipper-handle
broke."</p>

<p>"The dipper-handle? On the big dredge? Sally
Lou, how dreadful!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is dreadful. It means, of course, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
twenty of the laborers will stop work and enjoy a
vacation at the company's expense while the
new handle is being made and put in. Luckily
the boys have one set of duplicate chains and
timbers, and the company blacksmith is wonderfully
capable. But it will cost the company a
lump loss of a thousand dollars. Imagine, Marian,
how those poor boys will groan when they make
out their week's reports for President Sturdevant.
'One fire. One delay and two cave-ins, due to
non-appearance of district inspector. One strike.
One smashed dipper-handle.' Think what a dismal
task the writing of that report will be!"</p>

<p>"Don't let me hear any more croaking, Sally
Lou," came a wrathful voice from the door.
"For we're facing the worst smash yet. What do
you suppose this telegram says?"</p>

<p>Sally Lou shook a small fist at the yellow slip
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare tell me that it's some new
misfortune!"</p>

<p>"Two of 'em. That lordly, gloomy grouch, Mr.
Ellingworth Locke, acting president of the Central
Mississippi Association, is headed for this luckless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
camp. He's on his way up-river this identical
minute. With him comes Crosby. Crosby, consulting
engineer for the whole Valley Association.
Coming on a tour of inspection, <i>if</i> you please.
Just think of the lovely job that they have come a
thousand miles to inspect!"</p>

<p>There was a stricken pause.</p>

<p>"President Locke! That&mdash;that potentate! Ned,
you don't mean it! And Mr. Crosby, whose word
is law on every question of engineering!"</p>

<p>"And they're coming to-day! To 'inspect'
this soaking, miry, half-baked camp!"</p>

<p>"And just this minute I've had some more
news, Burford." Roderick bolted up the steps
and entered the room. He tried to wrench his
face into a reassuring grin; but beneath the grin
he was the picture of angry dismay. "A big
white launch is just coming up the canal, with two
passengers aboard. If I'm not mistaken, they are
our honored guests. Come along, Burford, and
help me welcome them."</p>

<p>Burford, pop-eyed with amazement, meekly
obeyed. Wordless, the two girls watched the boys
pelt away toward the landing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>Sally Lou and Marian looked at each other
eloquently.</p>

<p>"Well! I could find it in my heart to wish that
the boys were not obliged to unfold quite so many
tales of misery! Then the broken machinery and
the quarrelling laborers! But we mustn't let ourselves
fidget over it, Marian. It will come out all
right, somehow."</p>

<p>Roderick and Burford pounded down to the
shore. The white launch was just putting into
the landing. At the bow sat Mr. Ellingworth
Locke, wrapped in a huge storm coat. Evidently
he was scolding the launch pilot with some
energy. Behind him stood Crosby, his gray, keen
eyes searching every inch of the ditch construction.</p>

<p>"His Jove-like Majesty looks even grumpier
than usual," whispered Burford the irreverent.
"Come along, Hallowell. It is our professional
duty to welcome them with heart and soul."</p>

<p>"Mr. Burford?" Mr. Locke stepped upon the
landing and put out a plump gloved hand. "Ah,
Mr. Hallowell? How goes it? We hope that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
have no ill news of the contract to give us."
He led the way up the shore, with ponderous
dignity. "The three contracts in central Illinois,
which we have just inspected, have shown deplorable
results from the high water. I trust
that you have no such misfortunes to report."</p>

<p>"We haven't anything but misfortunes to report,"
muttered Burford. Aloud he said, "We
have not been able to bring the work to the desired
point, sir. We have had several accidents and
delays. If you can face the discomforts of a boat
trip in this rain, perhaps you will make a tour of
inspection and see how matters stand."</p>

<p>The honorable Mr. Locke hesitated. The canal
looked very muddy and uninviting. The sky was
black with rain clouds.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be as well for us to confer
with you. Then we could go back to Saint Louis
immediately."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Mr. Locke." Mr. Crosby spoke
for the first time. His gray face had no particular
expression; but his voice held an oddly pleasant
note. "You go back right away, if you like. But
I'll look over this excavation with my own eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
I want to discuss it with the executive committee
day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, if you insist!" Mr. Locke
turned impatiently to Burford. "Where is your
boat, sir? Let us start at once."</p>

<p>That tour of inspection! Silent, humiliated,
miserable, Roderick and Burford plodded after
the two Olympians, up and down the narrow
laterals, back and forth through the maze of seeping,
half-cut channels. Every question that they
must answer told of some unlucky happening.
Every report was apologetic, unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>"This ruinous high water isn't our fault.
Neither is Carlisle's illness, nor the broken dipper-handle,
nor the district inspector's delay. Just
the same I feel like a penny-in-the-slot machine
for grinding out explanations," whispered Roderick
to Burford. Burford merely scowled in reply.</p>

<p>Thus far, Mr. Crosby had had nothing to say.
He strode on ahead, his keen eyes judging, his
shrewd mouth shut hard. President Locke made
up for his silence. He hectored the boys with
fretful questions and complaints. He criticised
the laborers, the equipment, the weather.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>"Your company's losses, indeed! The Breckenridge
Company will be fortunate, Mr. Burford,
if, under the present management, this contract
does not bring forfeitures as well as loss. As for
the land-owners in this district, their dissatisfaction
can be only too readily imagined."</p>

<p>Just then the president caught Mr. Crosby's eye.</p>

<p>"Do you not agree with me, Mr. Crosby? Is
not this a most disheartening outlook? On my
word, sir, the company has no chance to complete
those laterals before the great June freshets. That
calamity will mean ruin for the farmers and for the
contract alike. To finish this work would be
difficult with a full quota of experienced men.
And with only cub engineers&mdash;" He threw out
both fat hands, with a gesture of despairing scorn.</p>

<p>Burford bit his lip and turned fiery red with
mortification. Roderick's stolid face did not
flinch. But his heart sank leaden to his miry
boots. What an infuriating humiliation for the
company! His company, the pride of his boy
heart! And Breckenridge, Breck his hero, would
have to hear it all!</p>

<p>"You think it's as bad as all that?" Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Crosby spoke with slow, bland unconcern. Then
he looked at the two boys. For one moment his
lean gray face lighted with a curious, kindly
sparkle. "H'm! Strikes me that their company
is mighty lucky to have cub engineers employed
on this job."</p>

<p>"'Lucky?' Why, sir? Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, because they're the only kind that any
company can depend upon to have nerve enough
and grit enough to swing such a forlorn hope of
a contract through."</p>

<p>He tramped on, up the landing. Burford threw
back his shoulders. The blood flamed to his ears.
Roderick's heart suddenly leaped up to its normal
altitude and began to pound. His lagging feet
swung into a jaunty stride. He met Burford's
red, delighted face with a shamefaced grin. That
vote of confidence had fairly set them afire.</p>

<p>"At what time had we best start back to Saint
Louis?" asked Mr. Locke.</p>

<p>"By leaving camp at nine-thirty you will meet
the north-bound limited at Grafton, sir."</p>

<p>"Then, Crosby, we will stay here until that hour.
But where shall we dine?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be a pleasure to Mrs. Burford and myself
if you and Mr. Crosby will dine with us at
our cabin," interposed Burford eagerly.</p>

<p>The stout potentate graciously accepted, and
Burford fled to break the news to Sally Lou.</p>

<p>"Mercy, Sally Lou, how can you manage it!"
cried Marian, as Burford popped his head through
the window, shouted his news, then hastily departed.
"How on earth can you entertain such
high mightinesses?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should hope that I could give them
one meal at least."</p>

<p>"But you haven't enough dishes. That is, you
haven't cups that match&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cups that match, indeed! H'm. They can
be thankful to get any cups at all in this wilderness.
I've promised Mammy Easter my pink
beads if she'll make us some beaten biscuit, and I
have sent Mulcahy to Mrs. Gates's for three
chickens, and I'll open two jars of my white
peach preserve. I don't care if they're the
Grand Mogul and the Czar of all the Russias,
they can surely condescend to eat Mammy's fried
chicken."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, they'll be sure to like chicken," conceded
Marian.</p>

<p>"They'd better like it. It's all they're going
to get. Chicken and potatoes and biscuit, preserves
and coffee, that's all. Yes, and lashin's
and lavin's of cream gravy. It'll be fit for a king.
Even his Highness, the acting president, won't
dare complain!"</p>

<p>If any complaints as to Sally Lou's hospitality
were spoken, they were not audible to the human
ear. As Roderick said afterward, it was fortunate
that nobody kept the beaten biscuit score; while
one grieves to relate that in spite of Sally Lou's
generous preparation, poor Mammy Easter was
obliged to piece out an exceedingly skimpy meal
from the fragments of the supper, instead of the
feast that she had anticipated. Even the pink
beads proved a barely adequate consolation.</p>

<p>The hour that followed, spent before the Burfords'
tiny hearth-fire, was the best of all. For
a while, the men worked over the mass of blueprints
that recorded the excavation made during
the month past. Here President Locke, the
magnificent figure-head, gave way, promptly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
meekly, before Crosby's wider experience. Roderick
and Burford listened, all ears, to the elder man's
shrewd illuminating comment, his quiet suggestion,
his amused friendly sympathy. Both groaned inwardly
when the launch whistled from below, a
warning that their guests must be off to meet the
north-bound train.</p>

<p>President Locke bowed over Sally Lou's hand
with majestic courtesy.</p>

<p>"A most delightful hour you have given us,
Mrs. Burford. We shall remember it always and
with deep pleasure. But one thing is lacking in
your hospitality. You have not given us the
special pleasure of meeting your young sons."</p>

<p>Then Sally Lou, the poised stately young hostess,
colored pink to her curly fair hair.</p>

<p>"It is high time that my sons were sound
asleep," said she. "But if you really wish to see
them, and can overlook their informal attire,
Mammy Easter shall bring them in."</p>

<p>In came two small podgy polar bears, wide-eyed
at the marvel of company, and up-at-Nine-o'clock,
dimpling, crimson-cheeked. Roderick and
Burford stood gaping, to behold their august superiors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
now stooping from their heights to beguile
small Edward and shy Thomas Tucker with
clumsy blandishments.</p>

<p>"<i>Where</i> did you learn to handle a baby like
that?" gasped Sally Lou, so astonished at Mr.
Crosby's dexterous ease that she forgot all convention.</p>

<p>"Six of my own," returned the eminent engineer,
capably shifting small, slippery Thomas Tucker
on his gaunt shoulder. "All grown up, I regret to
say. My baby girl is a junior at Smith this year.
Try him. Isn't he a stunner for a year old?"
He plumped the baby into the arms of the lordly
president, who was already jouncing Edward
Junior on his knee and showing him his watch.</p>

<p>"A whale," approved President Locke, with
impressive emphasis. He stood up, gaining his
footing with some difficulty; for both the babies
were now clambering over him delightedly, while
Finnegan yapped and nipped his ankles with
cordial zest. "I wish we might spend another
hour with these most interesting members of your
household, Mr. Burford." His stern, arrogant face
was beaming; he was no longer the exacting official,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
but the gracious, kindly gentleman. "Since
we must go, we will leave behind us our good
wishes, as well as our thanks for your most charming
hospitality. And we will take with us"&mdash;his
eye sought Mr. Crosby's; there passed between
the two men a quick, satisfied glance&mdash;"we
shall take with us our hearty certainty that
these good wishes for your husband's work, as
well as for his household, will be abundantly fulfilled."</p>

<p class="p2">In the flickering torchlight of the landing
Roderick and Ned watched their launch start
away. Then they looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Well! Do you feel like tackling your job
again, Burford?"</p>

<p>"Feel like tackling it!" Ned chuckled, softly.
"When I know they're going to give their executive
committee a gilt-edged report of our company
and its work! When Crosby himself said that we
were the right men on the right job! Feel like
tackling it? Give me a shovel and I'll tackle
the Panama Canal."

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
A LONG PULL AND A STRONG PULL</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the latest bulletin, Sally Lou?"</p>

<p>Ned Burford, hot, muddy, breathless, ran up
the martin-box steps and put his head inside the
door.</p>

<p>Sally Lou sat at Ned's desk, her brown eyes
intent, her cheeks a little pale. A broad map
lay spread before her. One hand steadied small
Thomas Tucker, who clung against her knee. The
other hand grasped the telephone receiver.</p>

<p>"What's the news, I say? Doesn't central
answer? Wires down again, do you s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, central answered, and we reached the
operator at Bates Creek an hour ago. She says
that the smaller streams below Carter's Ford have
not risen since daybreak, but that Bates Creek
itself has risen three inches in the last four hours."</p>

<p>"Whew! Three inches since morning! That
sounds serious. What about Jackson River?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>"Below Millville the Jackson has flooded its
banks. Above Millville the men are patrolling
the levees and stacking in sand bags and brush to
reinforce the earthwork."</p>

<p>"That means, another crest of water will reach
us to-morrow, early. Well, we are ready to face
it, I'm thankful to say." Ned settled back in his
big chair with a sigh of relief. "That is, unless
it should prove to be more than a three-foot rise.
And there is practically no danger that it will go
beyond that stage. Our upper laterals are excavated
to final depth. Our levee is growing like
magic, and Hallowell is putting in splendid time
on the lower laterals with the big dredge. So we
needn't worry. As soon as he finishes all the lateral
excavation, he will bring the dredges down to the
main ditch and start in to deepen the channel
to its final depth. When that second excavation
is done, the channel will allow for a six-foot rise.
That channel depth, of course, will put us far out
of any danger of overflow. Then when the June
floods come, the creeks can rise four inches or
forty inches if they like. We won't care."</p>

<p>Sally Lou looked sharply at his grimy, cheerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
face. Her own did not reflect his contentment.
She put down the receiver and bent frowning over
the map. Her pencil wandered over the maze of
fine red lines that marked the excavation.</p>

<p>"Hallowell and I had nothing but bad luck on
this contract until two weeks ago, when Locke
and Crosby came on their inspection tour," Ned
went on serenely. "But since their visit, we've
had two solid weeks of the best fortune any engineer
could ask. It has been almost too good;
it's positively uncanny. Not a break in the machinery;
only one cave-in, and that a trifle; not
a solitary quarrel among the laborers&mdash;the shifts
have moved like clock-work. It was Crosby's
doing, I suppose. His coming heartened us all
up; all of us; even to the dredges themselves.
Though, on my word, Sally Lou, I'm almost
afraid of such unchanging good luck. It's no'
canny."</p>

<p>Sally Lou turned to him suddenly. Her fingers
tapped the desk with nervous little clicks.</p>

<p>"Listen, Ned. Have you finished the upper
laterals? Are they safe, no matter how high the
water may rise?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>"N-no. They are excavated, but the bank is
nothing but heaped mud, you know. Still, it would
stand anything short of a flood."</p>

<p>"What about the lower laterals?"</p>

<p>"Same state of affairs there. Only that the two
lowest ditches aren't cut at all. Why?"</p>

<p>Sally Lou swung round in the desk chair and
faced her husband. Her eyes were very dark and
anxious now.</p>

<p>"One more question, Ned. Could the work
stand a three-foot rise?"</p>

<p>Ned stared.</p>

<p>"A three-foot rise? No, it could not. A
three-foot rise would stop our levee-building. A
rise of four feet or more would put us out of the
game. We'd be washed out, smashed, ruined.
But why do you ask such questions? What makes
you imagine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not imagining, Ned. I had a telephone
call not five minutes ago from the district inspector.
Yes, I know you think he's always shouting 'Wolf!'
but this time he may be right. He says that he has
just come down from Chicago on the Central, and
that the whole mid-section of the State is fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
submerged by these endless rains. Worse, the
storm warnings are up for further rains. And he
believes that there will be a rise of three feet within
two days. That is, unless the rains stop."</p>

<p>Ned started to his feet.</p>

<p>"A rise of three feet! What is the man talking
about? Don't you believe one word, Sally Lou.
That inspector is a regular hoot-owl. He'd rather
gloom and forebode than breathe. But maybe
I'd better go and tell Hallowell. Perhaps we can
ginger up our excavation. Yet the men and the
machines are working up to their limit."</p>

<p>He shuffled into his wet oilskins once more.</p>

<p>"Where is Roderick, Ned?"</p>

<p>"He just came in off his watch. He's sound
asleep in the hammock over at his shack. Marian
is over there too. She made Mr. Gates bring her
down at five this morning, and she has worked
like a Turk every minute. She spent the morning
with Hallowell, up the laterals. She has learned
to run his launch better that he can, so he lets her
manage the boat for him. Then she takes all his
notes, and does all his telephoning, and passes along
his orders to the commissary men, and seconds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
him at every turn. Did you ever in all your life
see anybody change as she has done? When I
remember the listless, useless, fretful specimen
that she was, those first weeks, then look at her
now, I can hardly believe my eyes."</p>

<p>Sally Lou listened a little impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Ned, please go and tell Roderick
about the inspector's message. He surely
ought to know."</p>

<p>"All right, I'm going." Ned put down his
frolicking small sons reluctantly. Sally Lou
laughed at his unwilling face. Yet she looked
after him anxiously as he sauntered away. Then
her eyes turned to the brimming canal. Tree
branches and bits of lumber, washed down from
the upper land by the heavy storm, rolled and
tumbled past. The sky was thick and gray, the
wind blew straight from the east.</p>

<p>"I hate to fidget and forebode. But I&mdash;I almost
wish that I could make Ned forebode a
little. I'm afraid he ought to worry. And Roderick
ought to be a little anxious, too."</p>

<p>Suddenly the telephone bell rang. Sally Lou
sprang to answer it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, this is the contract camp. A Chicago
call? Is it&mdash;Is it head-quarters? Oh, is this
<i>Mr. Breckenridge</i> who is speaking? Shall I call
Mr. Burford?"</p>

<p>Strong and clear across two hundred miles of
storm the voice reached her, a hurrying command.</p>

<p>"Do not call your husband. No time. Operator
says the wind raging here may break connections
at any minute. Tell him that we have positive
word that a tremendous rise is on the way. A
cloudburst north of Huntsville started this new
crest two hours ago. Moreover, a storm belt extends
across the State, covering a district thirty
miles wide directly north of you. Tell our engineers
to spare neither money nor effort in making
ready. Tell them, whatever else they must
neglect, to save&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Click!</p>

<p>The receiver dropped from Sally Lou's shaking
hand. Not another sound came over the wire.
She signalled frantically.</p>

<p>"Oh, if he had only told me! 'To save'&mdash;to
save <i>what</i>? The machinery, the levee, the laterals&mdash;Oh,
central, please, please!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>Still no sound. At last central's voice, a thin
little whisper.</p>

<p>"Chicago connections broken ... terrible storm
... sorry can't reach&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The thin little whisper dropped to silence.</p>

<p>"Mammy, take these babies. I'm going away."
Sally Lou rolled Thomas Tucker off her lap and
dashed away to Roderick's shack. Trembling,
she poured out her ill news.</p>

<p>"This means business." Roderick, heavy-eyed
and stupid, struggled into hip boots and slicker.
"Breckenridge isn't frightening us for nothing.
We daren't lose a minute. Come along, Burford."</p>

<p>"Come along&mdash;where?" Burford stood stunned
before this bewildering menace. "What more can
we do? Aren't we rushing the whole plant to
the danger notch of speed as it is?"</p>

<p>"There is one thing we must do. Decide what
part of the work we can abandon. Then put our
whole force, men, machinery, and all, to work at
the one point where it will do the most good."</p>

<p>"What can we abandon? It's all equally important."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>"That is for you and me to decide. Come
along."</p>

<p>"If Breck had only finished his sentence! 'To
save&mdash;' Surely he meant for us to save the
dredges?"</p>

<p>Again the boys looked at each other.</p>

<p>"To save the dredges, maybe. But that doesn't
sound like Breckenridge. 'To save the land-owners
from loss,' that's more like what he'd
say."</p>

<p>"If we could only reach him, for even half a
minute&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is precisely what we can't do." Roderick's
big shoulders lifted. His heavy face settled
into lines of steel. "We'll bring all three of the
machines down stream, and put up our fight on
the main ditch. If we can cut through to the
river, before the rise gets here, we will save the
crops for most of the land-owners, anyway. That
will check any danger of the water backing up
into the narrow laterals and overflowing them."</p>

<p>Burford frowned.</p>

<p>"Do you realize that by making that move we
shall risk wrecking the dredges? We will have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
tow them down in this rough, high water against
this heavy wind. We may smash and sink all
three. And they cost the company a cool twenty
thousand apiece, remember."</p>

<p>Roderick's jaw set.</p>

<p>"I realize just that. But it is up to us to decide.
If we stop our excavation and huddle the
machines back into the laterals, we will save our
equipment from any risk. But the overflow will
sweep the whole lower district and ruin every acre
of corn. On the other hand, if we bring the
dredges down here and start in full tilt to deepen
the channel, we may wreck our machines&mdash;and
we may not. But, whatever happens, we will be
giving the land-owners a chance."</p>

<p>Burford held back, but only for a moment.
Then he put out his hand to Roderick, with a slow
grin.</p>

<p>"I'm with you, Hallowell. I'll take your lead,
straight through. It's up to us, all right. We've
got to shoulder the whole responsibility, the whole
big, hideous risk. But we'll put it through.
That's all."</p>

<p>Together the boys hurried away. Left behind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the girls set to work upon their share of the plan
with eager spirit.</p>

<p>"You go with the boys and run the launch for
them, Marian. I'll turn the babies over to
Mammy and stay right here to watch the telephone
and keep the time-books, although time-books
could wait, in such a pinch as this. We'll
all pull together. And we will pull out safely,
never fear."</p>

<p>Sally Lou was right. They all pulled together.
Machines, laborers, foremen and all swung splendidly
into line. As Ned said, the contract had
never shown such team-work. Everybody worked
overtime. Everybody faced the rain, the mud,
the merciless hurry with high good-humor. The
thrill of danger, the daring risk, the loyal zeal
and spirit for the company, all spurred them on.</p>

<p>Side by side with Roderick, Marian worked
through the day. She had long since forgotten
her frail health. She had forgotten her hatred
of the dun western country, her dislike of Roderick's
work, her weariness, her impatience. With
heart and soul she stood by her brother. Only
the one wish ruled every act: her eager desire to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
help Roderick, to stand by him through to the end
of this tremendous strain.</p>

<p>"We'll make it!" Roderick grinned at her,
tired but content, as he came into the shack
for his late supper. "Sally Lou finally reached
Springfield on the telephone. The rain has
stopped; so while the rise will come, sure as fate,
yet it may not be as high as Breckenridge feared.
At any rate, we have made splendid time with the
big dredge to-day. There is barely an eighth of
a mile more cutting to be done. Then we'll reach
the river, and we'll be safe, no matter what
freshets may happen along. Burford says I'm
to take six hours' sleep; then I'll go on watch
again. Twelve more hours of working time will
see our land-owners secure."</p>

<p>"Ned Burford is running up the shore this
minute." Marian peered through the tent flap.
"Mulcahy is coming with him. They're in a
hurry. I wonder what has happened."</p>

<p>"They'd better not bring me any bad news till
I have eaten my supper," said Roderick grimly.</p>

<p>Burford and Mulcahy galloped up the knoll.
Headlong they plunged into the tent. Burford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
was gray-white. Mulcahy stared at Roderick
without a word.</p>

<p>"What has happened? Burford, what ails you?"</p>

<p>Burford sat down and mopped his sweating
forehead.</p>

<p>"The worst break-down yet, Hallowell. The
dipper-bail on the big dredge has snapped clear
through."</p>

<p>The three stared at each other in helpless despair.
Marian broke the silence.</p>

<p>"The dipper-bail broken <i>again</i>? Why, it's
not two weeks since you put on the new handle!"</p>

<p>"True for you, miss. Not two weeks since
it broke," said Mulcahy wrathfully. "And its
smash means a tie-up all along the line. Not one
stroke of ditch-work can be done till it's replaced.
Who ever saw a dipper break her bail twice on
the same job? 'Tis lightnin' strikin' twice in the
same place. But 'tis no use cryin' over spilt milk.
One of you gentlemen will have to go to Saint
Louis and have a new bail welded at the steam
forge. It will cost twenty-four hours' time, but
it is the only way. I'll keep the boys hot at
work on the levee construction meanwhile."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>"Go to Saint Louis to-night! And neither of
you two have had a night's sleep this week!"
Marian looked at Burford. His sodden clothes
hung on him. His round face was pinched and
sunken with fatigue. She looked at her brother.
He had slumped back in his chair, limp and haggard.
He was so utterly tired that even the shock
of ill news could not rouse him to meet its challenge.</p>

<p>Then she looked out at the weltering muddy
canal, the dark stormy sky.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Rod. We'll manage. You and
Ned make out the exact figures and dimensions
for the new bail. Then Mulcahy can take me to
Grafton in the launch. There I'll catch the Saint
Louis train. I'll go straight to the steam forge
and urge them to make your bail at once. Then
I'll bring it back on the train to-morrow night."</p>

<p>Promptly both boys burst into loud, astonished
exclamations.</p>

<p>"Go to Saint Louis alone! I guess I see myself
letting you do such a preposterous thing. I'll
start, at once."</p>

<p>"Stop that, Hallowell. You can't possibly go.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
You're so sleepy that you haven't half sense. I'll
go myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, you will. Then what about your watch
to-night? Shall I take it and my own, too?"</p>

<p>Burford stopped, quenched. He reddened with
perplexity.</p>

<p>"We can't either of us be spared, that's the fact
of it. But Miss Marian must not think of going."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I would never allow it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Rod, you will allow it." Marian spoke
quietly, but with determination. "The trip to
Saint Louis is perfectly safe. Once in the city,
I'll take a carriage to the College Club and stay
there every minute, except the time that I must
spend in giving orders for the bail. No, you two
need not look so forbidding. I'm going. And I'm
going this identical minute."</p>

<p>Later Marian laughed to remember how swiftly
she had overruled every protest. The boys were
too tired and dazed to stand against her. It was
hardly an hour before she found herself flying down
the river, in charge of the faithful Mulcahy, on her
way to catch the south-bound train.</p>

<p>"The steam-forge people will do everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
in their power to serve you," Roderick had said,
as he scrawled the last memoranda for her use.
"They know our firm, and they will rush the bail
through and have it loaded on the eight-o'clock
train. I'll see to it that Mulcahy and two men
are at the Grafton dock to meet your train. But
if anything should go wrong, Sis, just you hunt up
Commodore McCloskey and ask him to help you;
for the commodore is our guardian angel, I am
convinced of that."</p>

<p>The trip to the city was uneventful. She awoke
early, after a good rest, and hurried down to the
forge works, a huge smoky foundry near the
river. The shop foreman met her with the utmost
courtesy and promised that the bail should be
made and delivered aboard the afternoon train.
Feeling very capable and assured, Marian went
back to the club and had spent two pleasant hours
in its reading-room when she was called to the
telephone.</p>

<p>"Miss Hallowell?" It was the voice of the
forge works foreman. "I&mdash;er&mdash;most unluckily
we have mislaid the slip of paper which gave
the dimensions of the bail. We cannot go on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
until we have those dimensions. Do you remember
the figures?"</p>

<p>Poor Marian racked her brain. Not one measurement
could she call to mind.</p>

<p>"I'll ask my brother over the long-distance,"
she told the foreman. But even as she spoke, she
knew that there was no hope of reaching Roderick.
All the long-distance wires were down.</p>

<p>"And not one human being in all Saint Louis
who can tell me the size of that bail!" she groaned.
"Oh, why didn't I measure it with my own tape-measure&mdash;and
then learn the figures by heart!
Yet&mdash;I do wonder! Would Commodore McCloskey
know? He has been at the camp so often,
and he knows everything about our machinery.
Let's see."</p>

<p>Presently Commodore McCloskey's friendly
voice rang over the wire.</p>

<p>"Well, sure 'tis good luck that ye caught me
at the dock, Miss Marian. The <i>Lucy</i> is just startin'
up-river. Two minutes more and I'd have gone
aboard. So ye've lost the bail dimensions? Well,
well, don't talk so panicky-like. I'll be with ye
in two minutes, an' we'll go to the forge together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
'Tis no grand memory I have, but I can give them
a workin' idea."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you only will, commodore! But the
<i>Lucy</i>! How can you be spared?"</p>

<p>"Hoot, toot. The <i>Lucy</i> can wait while I go
shoppin' with you. Yes, she has a time schedule,
I know well. But, in high wather, whoever expects
a Mississippi packet to be on time? Or in
low wather, either, for that matter. I'll come to
ye at once."</p>

<p>The commodore was as good as his word.
Soon he and Marian reached the forge works.
There his shrewd observation and his wise old
memory suggested dimensions which proved later
to be correct in every detail. Moreover, he insisted
upon staying with Marian till the bail should
be welded. Then, under his sharp eyes, it was
loaded safely on the Grafton train. As he escorted
Marian elegantly into the passenger coach,
she ventured, between her exclamations of gratitude,
to reprove him very gently.</p>

<p>"You have been too good to me, commodore.
But when I think of the poor deserted <i>Lucy</i>!
And the captain&mdash;what will he say?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"He'll say a-plenty." The little commodore
smiled serenely. "'Tis an unchivalrous set the
steam-boat owners are, nowadays. If he were
half as obligin' as the old captains used to be in
the good days before the war, he'd be happy to
wait over twenty-four hours, if need be, to serve
a lady. But nowadays 'tis only time, time that
counts. Sure, he's grieved to the heart if we make
a triflin' loss, like six hours, say, in our schedule."</p>

<p>"And I'm not thanking you for myself alone,"
Marian went on, flushing. "It is for Rod, too.
You don't know how much it means to me to be
able to help him, even in this one small way."</p>

<p>Then the little commodore bent close to her.
His shrewd little eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>"Don't I know, sure? An' by that token I'm
proud of this day, and twice proud of the chance
that's led me to share it. For, sure, I've always
said it&mdash;the time would certain come when you&mdash;<i>when
you'd wake up</i>. Mind my word, Miss Marian.
Don't ye forget! Don't ye let go&mdash;and go to
sleep again."</p>

<p>The train jarred into motion. His knotted little
hand gripped hers. Then he was off and away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>"The dear little, queer little commodore!"
Marian looked after him, her eyes a bit shadowy.
"Though what could he mean! 'Now you've
waked up.' I do wonder!"</p>

<p>Yet her wonder was half pretended. A hot
flush burned in her cheek as she sat thinking of
his words.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad, too, that I've 'waked up,'
although I wish that something had happened to
stir me earlier."</p>

<p>The train crept on through the flooded country.
It was past eight o'clock when they reached
Grafton. Marian hurried from the coach and
watched anxiously while two baggagemen hoisted
the heavy bail from the car.</p>

<p>"Well, my share is done," she said to herself.
"That precious bail is here, safe and sound. But
where is Mulcahy? And the launch? Rod said
that he would not fail to be here by train time."</p>

<p>The train pulled out. From the dim-lit station
the ticket agent called to her.</p>

<p>"You're expecting your launch, Miss Hallowell?
There has been no boat down to-day."</p>

<p>"But my brother promised to send the launch,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
stammered Marian. "Surely they knew I was
coming to-night!"</p>

<p>Then, in a flash of recollection, she heard Roderick's
voice:</p>

<p>"And Mulcahy will meet you on the eight-o'clock
train."</p>

<p>"Rod meant the train that leaves Saint Louis
at eight in the morning! Not this afternoon train.
How could I make such a blunder! He does not
look for me to reach Grafton till to-morrow."</p>

<p>She looked at the huge, heavy bail.</p>

<p>"If that bail could reach camp to-night, they
could ship it up and start to cutting immediately.
It would mean seven or eight hours more of working
time. But how to take it there!"</p>

<p>"There's a man yonder who owns a gasolene-launch,"
ventured the agent. "It's a crazy, battered
tub, but maybe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marian looked out at the night: the black,
sullen river; the ranks of willows swaying in the
heavy wind; the thunder that told of approaching
storm.</p>

<p>"Call that man over, please. Yes, I shall risk the
trip up-river. That bail shall reach camp to-night."
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
PARTNERS AND VICTORIES</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>"What time is it, miss?"</p>

<p>Marian put down the gallon tin with which she
had bailed steadily, and looked at her watch.</p>

<p>"Almost midnight."</p>

<p>"Only midnight!"</p>

<p>The steersman gave a weary yawn and turned
back to his wheel. Inwardly Marian echoed his
discouraged word. It seemed to her that she had
crouched for years in the stern of the crazy little
motor-boat. Rain and spray had drenched her
to the skin. She ached in every half-frozen bone.
Yet she sat, wide awake and alert, watching her
pilot keenly.</p>

<p>He was a poor helmsman, she thought. However,
an expert would have found trouble in taking
an overloaded launch up-stream against that swollen
current and in pitch darkness. Worse, the
weight of the heavy dredge-bail weighed the launch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
down almost to water level. Every tiny wave
splashed over the gunwale. Marian bailed on
mechanically.</p>

<p>She had had hard work to bribe the owner to
risk the trip up-stream. The men at Grafton had
warned her, moreover, that she was running a narrow
chance of swamping the launch, and thus of
losing her precious piece of machinery, to say
nothing of the danger to her own life. But all
Marian's old timidity had fled, forgotten. Nothing
else mattered if just she might serve her brother
in his supreme need.</p>

<p>Through these four dreary hours the old commodore's
quaint, frank words had echoed in her
mind. And the commodore had been right, she
owned, with a quiver of shame. Always, since
their mud-pie days, Rod had done his part by
her in full measure, generously, lovingly. Never,
until these last days, had she even realized what
doing her own part by Roderick might mean.</p>

<p>"Although I have been slower than my blessed
old Slow-Coach himself in realizing what my life
ought to count for. Well, as the commodore said,
I have waked up at last. And mind this, Marian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Hallowell! <i>You stay awake!</i> Never, never let me
catch you dozing off again!"</p>

<p>"There's the camp light yonder," the steersman
spoke at last, with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Marian peered ahead through the cold, blinding
mist. Away up-stream shone a feeble glimmer,
then a second light; a third.</p>

<p>"Good! And&mdash;there are the dredge search-lights!
Only a minute more and we'll be there."</p>

<p>Only a minute it seemed till the launch wheezed
up to the landing and swung with a thud against
the posts. Marian stumbled ashore.</p>

<p>"Mulcahy!" she called to the dark figure standing
on the dredge deck. "Send two men to unload
the bail for us."</p>

<p>"Marian Hallowell! Where under the shining
sun did you come from?" Roderick leaped from
the deck to the shore and confronted his sister.
Then, in his horrified surprise at her daring risk,
he pounced upon her and administered a scolding
of such vigor that it fairly made her gasp.</p>

<p>"Of all the outrageous, reckless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there, Rod! Look!"</p>

<p>Still breathing threatenings and slaughter, Roderick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
turned. Then he saw the huge new bail
which the men were hoisting ashore.</p>

<p>"So that's what it all means! That's why you
came up on the early train! You brought that
bail yourself, all the way. You risked your life in
that groggy little boat! All on purpose to help
us out! Marian Hallowell, I'd like to shake you
hard. And for two cents I'd kiss you right here
and now. You&mdash;you <i>peach</i>!"</p>

<p>Burford, awakened by the launch whistle, was
hurrying down the bank. Reaching the landing
his eye fell on the precious new bail.</p>

<p>Utterly silent, he stared at it for a long rapt
minute. Then, rubbing his sleepy eyes, he turned
to Marian and Rod with a grin that fairly lighted
up the dock.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, with slow exultation, "now&mdash;we've
got our chance to win."</p>

<p>And win they did.</p>

<p>True, the water had already risen close to the
dreaded three-foot danger-mark. True, neither
of the boys had had half a dozen hours of sleep in
three days. As for the laborers, they were fagged
and overworked to the limit of their endurance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
But not one of these things counted. Not a grumbling
word was spoken. This was their company's
one chance. Not a man held back from seizing
that chance and making good. Not a man
but felt himself one with the company, a living
vital element of that splendid struggling whole.</p>

<p>Marian and Sally Lou stood on the shore watching
the dredge as the great dipper crunched its
way through the last submerged barrier. The
canal rolled bank full. Little waves swashed over
the platform on which they stood. Pools of seep-water
already gathered behind the mud embankment,
which was crumbling into miry avalanches
with every sweep of rising water against it. Not
by any chance could the levee stand another hour.
But even as the dredge cut that narrow passage,
the heavy overflow boiled outward into the river
beyond. Minute by minute the rough surface of
the canal was sinking before their watching eyes.
Now it had fallen from six inches above to high-water
mark; now to three inches below; now to
mid-stage&mdash;and safety.</p>

<p>As the freed stream rolled out into the river, a
great cheer rose from the laborers crowded alongshore.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Roderick and Burford stayed aboard the
dredge until it was warped alongside the dock and
safely moored. Then they crossed to land and
joined the girls. Neither of the boys spoke one
word. They did not seem to hear the shouts and
cheers behind them. There was no glow of success
on their sober faces. Perhaps their relief was so
great that they were a little stunned before its
wonder. Victory was theirs; but victory won in
the face of so great a danger that they could not
yield and feel assured of their escape.</p>

<p>"We cannot reach head-quarters on the telephone,
of course. But, by hook or crook, one of
you boys must get a despatch through to Mr.
Breckenridge. Think of being able to tell him
that you have deepened the canal straight through
to the river, so that the whole lower half of the district
is safe from overflow! And that you have
moved all these costly, treacherous machines
down-stream without one serious accident, without
so much as a broken bolt! It is too good to
be true."</p>

<p>"I'll take a launch and sprint down to Grafton
and wire our report from there," said Burford.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
His tense face relaxed; he broke into a delighted
chuckle. "Think of it: this once I can actually
enjoy sending in my report to head-quarters! I'd
like to write it out instead of wiring it. I'd put
red-ink curlycues and scroll-work dewdabs all over
the page. Think, Hallowell, you solemn wooden
Indian! The crest of this flood is only two hours
away. By noon the highest level will reach our
canal. But it can't flood our district for us,
for&mdash;for we got there first!"</p>

<p>His rosy face one glow of contentment, he started
toward the pier. But as he was about to step
aboard the duty-launch, Roderick hailed him
sharply.</p>

<p>"Wait, Burford. Somebody is coming up the
big ditch. A large gray launch, with a little dark-blue
flag."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>Burford sprang back. He shaded his eyes and
looked down the canal. Then, to Rod's amazement,
he sat down on a pile of two-by-fours and
rocked to and fro.</p>

<p>"Whatever ails you, Burford?"</p>

<p>"Whatever ails me, indeed!" Burford choked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
it out. His ears were scarlet. His eyes were fairly
popping from his head with delight. "Oh, I
reckon I won't bother to send that report to head-quarters,
after all. I'll just let the whole thing
slide."</p>

<p>Rod gaped at him.</p>

<p>"Have you lost your last wit, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Not quite. I'm going to give my report to my
superior officer by word of mouth. That big gray
power-boat is one of our own company's launches.
That small blue flag is the company ensign. And
that big gray man standing 'midships is&mdash;Breckenridge!
Breck the Great, his very self."</p>

<p>"Breckenridge!"</p>

<p>"Breckenridge. All there, too&mdash;every splendid
inch of him. Talk about luck! Our levee is
saved. Our dredges are all anchored, right yonder,
trim as a gimlet. Our schedule is put through
up to the minute. And here, precisely on the
psychological moment, comes our chief on his tour
of inspection. Can you beat that?"</p>

<p>Roderick merely stared down the canal.</p>

<p>Close behind the launch pilot, scanning the bank
intently as they steamed by, towered a broad-shouldered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
heavily built man, gray-headed, yet
powerful and alert in every movement. He was
well splashed with mud; his broad, heavily featured
face was colorless with fatigue. Yet as he
stood there, with his big tense body, his tired,
eager face, he seemed like some magnificent natural
force imprisoned in human flesh.</p>

<p>"Isn't he sumptuous, though?" said Burford,
under his breath. "Look at those shoulders!
What a half-back he would make!"</p>

<p>"Half-back? Why, he could make the All-American,"
Rod whispered back. His eyes were
glued to that tall approaching figure. His heart
was pounding in his breast. So this was Breckenridge
the Great, his hero! And, marvel of marvels,
he looked the hero of all Rod's farthest dreams.</p>

<p>Breckenridge stepped from the launch and shook
hands heartily with the radiant and stammering
Burford. He looked at Roderick with steady
dark eyes. He hardly spoke in reply to Burford's
introduction. But the grip of his big, muscular
hand was warmly cordial.</p>

<p>He asked a few brief questions. Then he listened,
his heavy head bent, his heavy-lidded eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
half closed, to Burford's eager account of their
struggles and their triumphs. Almost without
speaking he clambered into the launch again and
motioned the boys to follow.</p>

<p>For four consecutive hours the three went up
and down the rough miry channels. Roderick
steered the launch. Burford answered Breckenridge's
occasional questions. Breckenridge stood,
field-glass in hand, sweeping first one bank, then
another with tireless eyes. He made almost no
comment on Burford's explanations; but the slow
occasional nod of his massive head was eloquent.</p>

<p>Finally they retraced the last lateral and
brought the launch up to the main landing.</p>

<p>"No, I'll not stop to dine with you, much as
I should enjoy it. I must be getting on to the
next contract. They're seeing heavy weather
too." Breckenridge stood up, stretching his big,
cramped body. As he stood there, brushing the
clay from his coat, he seemed to loom.</p>

<p>"I have nothing much to say to you fellows,"
he went on in his quiet, casual voice, "only to
remark that you must have worked like Trojans.
You have made a far larger yardage record than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
we had dared to expect. You've put brains into
your work, too. Can't say I'm surprised at your
success, by the way. I was pretty certain from
what Crosby said that you two would swing this
contract, all right. Crosby and I had a talk in
Chicago a week or so ago. We were in Tech
together. Naturally he's quite a pal of mine,
though nowadays we're opponents in a business
way. But his opinion weighs heavily with me.
And now that I have gone over the ground for myself,
I am inclined to think that Crosby rather&mdash;well,
that he underestimated your services to the
company." Again his big head bent with that
queer slow nod. For a moment Breck himself,
the real man, alert, just, keenly understanding,
flashed a glance from behind that heavy mask of
splendid, impassive flesh. "Later you will probably
receive a more detailed explanation of my
opinion on your work. Good luck to you both,
and good-by."</p>

<p>He stepped into the launch. The powerful
boat dashed away down the rough yellow canal.</p>

<p>The boys stood and looked after him. Burford
was wildly exultant. But Roderick was silent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
A curious, deep satisfaction lighted his stolid,
boyish face. Every word that Breckenridge had
spoken was tingling in his blood. At last he
had met his hero face to face, man to man. And
his hero had proven all that heart could ask.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what he meant by saying that
you'd hear further as to his opinion on your
work," pondered Marian.</p>

<p>Just two days later her wish was gratified.</p>

<p class="p2">It was a rainy, dreary day. Rod had spent the
morning up the laterals and had come home dripping.
Marian was trying to dry his soaked clothes
before the smoky little oil-stove, but without much
success. Just before noon she heard a welcome
whistle. She ran down the bank to meet the rural
delivery-man in his little spider-launch. The
roads were long since impassable; the mail and
all the camp supplies must come by water.</p>

<p>"Stacks of letters, Rod. A fat official one for
the Burfords and a still fatter, more official one
for you. Do read it and tell me your news."</p>

<p>"All right, Sis." Rod pushed aside his blueprints
and set to opening his mail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>Marian looked over her own letters. They were
all of a sort: pleasant, affectionate notes from her
friends at home. All, with one accord, besought
her to hurry back to college for commencement.
All earnestly pitied her for the tedious weeks that
she was spending "in that rough, dreadful western
country."</p>

<p>Marian's eyes twinkled as she read. At the
bottom of the pile lay a note from her good friend
Isabel, begging her for the twentieth time to
spend August with her in her beautiful home at
Beverly Farms.</p>

<p>Marian read that letter twice. Her dark brows
narrowed.</p>

<p>Before her eyes gleamed Isabel's home, the great
beautiful house, set on a terraced emerald-green
hill. Behind it, dark, cool, mysterious, lay the
pine woods; before it flashed and gleamed the sea.
She could see its wide, stately rooms, its soft-hued,
luxurious furnishings. She could feel the
atmosphere of quiet contentment, of assured ease,
which was to Isabel and her mother the very air
they breathed.</p>

<p>Then she looked around her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>Here she sat in a tiny canvas shack with a
rough board floor. She looked at its mended
chairs, its rag-tag rug, and stringy curtains;
Rod's wet clothes, dripping before the little oil-stove;
Rod's battered desk, heaped with papers
and blue-prints, a mass of accumulated work.
Then she looked through the tent-flap. Neither
blue ocean nor deep, still forest met her eyes.
Only a narrow, muddy ditch; a row of wind-torn
willows; a dark, swollen river, hurrying on beneath
a dark, sinister sky.</p>

<p>An exclamation from Rod startled her. He
stooped to her, his tired face burning. With unsteady
fingers he put a letter into her hand.</p>

<p>"Read that, Sis. No, I'll not read it aloud to
you. Look at it with your own eyes."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

office of the superintendent.</p>
<p>Roderick T. Hallowell, C. E.,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span >: I beg to state that certain changes in the
engineering force of the company have brought
about a change in the position occupied by yourself
with our firm. Beginning upon the first day
of June, 1912, you will be transferred to the post
of assistant superintendent on a large drainage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
contract in northern Iowa. While your position
will be second to that of Mr. McPherson, our
supervising engineer, yet you will be given entire
charge of the assembling of the plant and its construction.
Your salary will be two thousand dollars.
Payment quarterly, as is our custom.</p>

<p>Some objections to this promotion have been
raised by members of our company on the score
of your limited experience. Mr. Breckenridge,
however, considers from his observation of your
methods that you will prove fully equal to this
exacting and responsible position.</p>

<p>Silent, wide-eyed, Marian read this amazing
document. Then, with a cry of surprise and delight,
she turned to her brother. But before she
could speak, a storm of eager feet dashed up the
cabin steps. In burst Sally Lou and Ned, headlong.
Ned, breathless with excitement, waved a
long official envelope. But Sally Lou, close at
his heels with Thomas Tucker crowing on her arm,
poured out the wild tale.</p>

<p>"Oh, Marian! Oh, Roderick! Oh, it's too
good and grand and glorious to be true! We're
going home, home, straight back to Virginia!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, we're going home, we're fired," puffed
Ned, as Sally Lou paused for breath. He sank
down on the bench with a sigh of ecstasy. "Don't
look so dazed, Hallowell. There is more news
coming. We're ordered off this contract. But
we're not ordered out of the Breckenridge Engineering
Company. Not quite yet. Instead, I'm
directed to report on the Dismal Swamp Canal
the first of the month. My position will be practically
the same as the one that I'm now holding.
But we can live at home. <i>At home</i>, I say! Right
in Norfolk, right in the midst of all Sally Lou's
own home-folks, right around the corner from my
own father's house. Won't we have a glorious
year of it! And won't Edward Junior and Thomas
Tucker be good and spoiled, though!"</p>

<p>"We're so happy we can't even say it to each
other!" Sally Lou sat down suddenly, hiding her
April face in Thomas Tucker's small pinafore.
"It took Mammy Easter to express our feelings
for us. 'Land, honey,' said she, 'I cert'n'y am
thankful that we's goin' back to civilization. I
want to climb on a real street-car again. I want
to ride in an elevator. I don't care if I never sets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
foot in one of dem slippery little launches again,
long's I live. But most of all I want to tote dese
lambs out of this swamp and on to de dry land
before dey grows up plumb web-footed.'"</p>

<p>In the midst of the laugh that followed, a launch
whistled from down the canal.</p>

<p>"There's Mulcahy now. Hurry, Ned. Go
down to Grafton and send your telegram to
head-quarters. Good-by, folks! Come over to
the martin-box to-night and we'll hold one last
celebration."</p>

<p>Sally Lou tossed her baby to her shoulder.
Away she sped beside her husband. Marian
looked after the gay, hurrying figures. Then,
still bewildered, she turned to Roderick.</p>

<p>"Well! What will happen next! Ned and
Sally Lou ordered to Virginia; you promoted&mdash;it
takes my breath away! But, Rod!" Her
voice rose with a startled note. She looked up
keenly at her brother's grave face. "You&mdash;you
dear, cold-blooded old slow-coach! How can you
look so pensive and perplexed? Of all the splendid,
splendid news! How could you keep still
and not tell the Burfords? How can you keep still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
now? If I wasn't so tired, I'd dance a jig right
here on your desk!"</p>

<p>"I ought to be dancing jigs myself," Roderick
answered. "I don't half deserve this magnificent
chance, I know that. But I&mdash;I don't know what
to say. I'm facing a dead wall."</p>

<p>"Rod, what do you mean? Of course you will
accept this promotion. You must. There can't
be any question!" Marian was on her knees by
his chair now, clasping his cold hands in her own.
Her voice rang sharp with angry affection. "Don't
halt and fumble so, brother! Don't you remember,
three months ago, how you fretted and hesitated
about taking the position that you are holding
to-day? See how you have succeeded in it!
Yet look at you! To-day you are wavering
and boggling and hanging back, just as you did
then."</p>

<p>"I'm hanging back, yes. But not for the same
reason." Roderick looked down at her with dark,
troubled eyes. "That time, I hesitated to accept
on your account. This time, I'm hesitating on my
own."</p>

<p>"Why, Roderick Hallowell! You are not afraid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
of hard work, nor of taking chances, either. Rod,
tell me this minute. Are you ill? What is it,
dear?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense. I'm perfectly well. But I am
tired out. I don't know how to tell you what I
mean. So tired that I dread the mere thought of
going on a new contract, and taking charge of a
new crew, and breaking myself in to a new piece
of work. Yes, it does sound cowardly. But I
cannot see my way clear. I don't believe I dare
take it up."</p>

<p>Marian looked at him closely.</p>

<p>"Sleep on this, Rod. A night's rest will give
you a different light on the matter."</p>

<p>"A night's rest won't make any difference in
the facts, Sis. The position is too complicated
for a greenhorn like me. I believe I could assemble
the plant, all right. And I think I could handle
the laborers. But the endless outside detail is
what I'm afraid of. That, and the responsibility,
too. For instance, on a contract like this one in
Iowa, the engineers must act as paymasters, each
for his division. That means, reckon the men's
time daily; make out their checks; handle their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
wages for them; and so on. Then there are my
tabulated reports for the head office. Then my
supplies. You have seen with your own eyes
how much time and work just the buying of coal
and machinery can demand. Then there would
be a thousand smaller matters to look after. Taking
it all in all, I don't want to make a try at this
offer, then fail. So the sensible thing to do is,
meekly to ask the company for a less impressive
post."</p>

<p>"All that you would need for the extra work that
you describe would be a competent book-keeper,
Rod."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Rod laughed shortly. "But a
'competent' book-keeper is the last employ that
one can find for such hard, isolated work as this.
What I need is not just a man to add columns for
me. I need another brain, an extra pair of hands.
I need the sort of first-aid that you have been giving
me all these weeks, Sis. That's the sort of
help that you can't buy for love nor money.
That's all."</p>

<p class="caption">MARIAN WAS ON HER KNEES BY HIS CHAIR, CLASPING HIS COLD HANDS IN HER OWN.</p>

<p>Marian studied her brother's face. When she
spoke, her voice was very gentle and low.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Rod. Telegraph head-quarters that
you will accept."</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;I am going to take that position as

<p>Roderick sat up with some vehemence.</p>

<p>"Marian Hallowell, I think I see myself letting
you do any more of my work. You're going back
to college next week, for commencement. Then
you may come West again, if you're determined to
stay somewhere near me. I'm mighty glad to have
you within reach, I must admit that. But you
are not to live down in the woods any longer.
And not another stroke of my work shall you do."</p>

<p>"Why not? Am I such a poor stenographer?"</p>

<p>Roderick laughed at her injured tone. Pride
and affection mingled in that laugh.</p>

<p>"You have been invaluable, Sis. You know
that perfectly well. I'd never have pulled through
this month without you. You have been of more
real use than any three ordinary stenographers
rolled together. For you have used your own
brains and will and courage. You have not stood
gracefully by and waited for orders. You have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
marched right on, and you have done a man's
work straight through. But our long pull is over
now. And you are well and strong again, I'm
thankful to say. So back to the East you go,
old lady. No more contract jobs for you."</p>

<p>Marian's eyes narrowed ominously. Deliberately
she seated herself on the arm of her brother's
chair. Gently but firmly she seized him by both
ears.</p>

<p>"Now, Roderick Hallowell, listen to me. Three
months ago the company offered you this position.
I wanted you to accept it. But, of all
things, I did <i>not</i> want to go West with you. I
teased and coaxed and whined. Much good my
whining did me. For you just set that Rock-o'-Gibraltar
chin of yours, and took me firmly by
the collar and marched me along.</p>

<p>"Now, Roderick Hallowell, look at me!"</p>

<p>Chuckling and shamefaced, Roderick struggled
to turn his face away; but Marian's fingers gripped
mercilessly tight.</p>

<p>"Look at me, I say. Answer. Didn't you
bully me into giving up to your wishes, by threatening
to refuse this position unless I'd come West
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
with you? Didn't you drag me out here willy-nilly?
Very well. You have had your way. You
have brought me here, and&mdash;<i>you can't send me
back</i>. There now."</p>

<p>"Marian, this is not fair." Roderick freed one
ear and looked sternly at his sister. "You must
finish your education. I have no right to keep
you trailing around the country with me, wasting
your time and cutting you off from your friends
and denying you any home comfort. You shall
not sacrifice yourself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sacrifice myself, indeed!" Marian took a
fresh grip. "All I ask is to stay with you until
next February. Then I'll go back and take up
my college work at the exact point where I laid it
down. I cannot graduate with my class, no matter
how hard I try. My illness last winter took too
much time. So I may as well join the class following,
at mid-years'. In the mean time, we will
have eight splendid months together. No, I have
waked up, Rod. You can't hush me off to my
selfish doze again."</p>

<p>"But, Marian, I can't possibly permit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can. And you will. As to home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
comforts&mdash;isn't it home, wherever we two are together?
As to being cut off from my friends&mdash;aren't
you the best chum I ever had? How
do you suppose I like being cut off from you,
brother?"</p>

<p>Rod did not answer. At last he looked up.
The sober gratitude in his eyes brought an answering
radiance to Marian's own.</p>

<p>"I give up, Sis. You shall stay with me for
the summer, anyway. Then we'll see. Now run
away, you blessed old partner!" His big hands
shut on her shoulders with an eloquent grip. "I'm
going to write to head-quarters and accept that
position before I have time to turn coward again
and change my mind."</p>

<p>Marian gave him a vigorous hug of satisfaction,
and ran away. Letter in hand, Roderick went to
his desk.</p>

<p>Carefully he set down his formal, courteous acceptance.
He read the finished letter with critical
care. Something was lacking. Yet he had taken
all possible pains. What more could his reply
need?</p>

<p>Suddenly his face brightened. He took up his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
pen. Slowly and carefully he added a final paragraph:</p>

<p>"In accepting this promotion, I wish to do so
with the understanding that my sister, Miss Hallowell,
who has acted as my assistant during the
past month, shall continue to hold that position
under the new contract. As her work is to be
counted as a part of my own, I will request that
my quarterly checks shall be made out, not to
R. T. Hallowell, but to 'Hallowell &amp; Hallowell,'
as the salary is to be drawn by us on a basis of
equal partnership."</p>

<p class="p2">He put down the finished sheet. His boyish
face lighted with a slow, triumphant glow. He
looked out across the gray wet country, the fog-banked
river. To his eyes the dull scene was
illumined. For his steady vision could see past
that gray dreariness, far up the broad high-road
of work and success that he had now set foot upon.
These three months of heavy toil had proven him.
He had seized his fighting chance, and he had
made good. And now all the royal chances of his
profession were waiting at his call.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>"Though I never could have put it through
without Marian," he said under his breath. "My
splendid, plucky little old Sis! No wonder I made
good, with such a partner. And from now on she
shall be my real partner, bless her heart. 'Hallowell
&amp; Hallowell,' now and forever!</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
